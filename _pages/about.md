<p>
My name is Patrick Lamber and I am a consultant specializing in Microsoft productivity software. </p>
<p>
My working career started in 2002 as a database and .NET software developer. After 2007 I had the opportunity to start working with SharePoint as a collaboration tool. It was love at first sight.</p>
<p>
Since the launch of Microsoft 365 (formerly Office 365), I gradually moved from the classic on-premises world to a cloud-based ecosystem.</p>
<p>
Fluent in Italian, English, and German, I have worked with a number of different companies from different sectors including Telecommunications, Retail, Sports, Energy, Healthcare, and Government.</p>

<h5>Hobbies</h5>
<p>
   Dancing has always been my go-to activity for all occasions. My love for dancing can be traced back to when I was a child. There are recorded videos of me as a teenager dancing rock-and-roll in many events. Today, I like to go dancing salsa with my wife.</p>
   <p>
Running is another activity I started a couple of years ago. Meanwhile, you can find me at some local running races or running at some marathons around the world.
