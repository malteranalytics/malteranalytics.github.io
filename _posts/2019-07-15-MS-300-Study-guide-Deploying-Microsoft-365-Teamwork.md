The [MS-300](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-ms-300.aspx) and [MS-301](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-ms-301.aspx) are required to obtain the **Microsoft 365 Certified: Teamwork Administrator Associate** certificate. Latter, is required with the exams [MS-100](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-ms-100.aspx) and [MS-101](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-ms-101.aspx) to obtain the [Microsoft 365 Certified Enterprise Administrator Expert](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/m365-enterprise-administrator.aspx).

The MS-300 exam tests Teamwork Administrators who are responsible for configuring, deploying, and managing Office 365 and Azure workloads that focus on efficient and effective collaboration and adoption. This job role is also involved with decisions regarding governance and works with other administrators to implement many of the decisions made by governance bodies. You must have a fundamental understanding of integration points with the following apps and services: Office, PowerApps, Flow, Yammer, Microsoft Graph, Stream, Planner, and Project.
