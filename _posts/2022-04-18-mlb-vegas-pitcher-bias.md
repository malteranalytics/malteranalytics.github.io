There’s no doubt that Gerrit Cole is an elite pitcher playing for a great team, the New York Yankees.  He finished second in the AL Cy Young award in 2021 with a 3.23 ERA, however, Vegas bettors seemed to think that the Yankees were a better team with Cole on the mound than they really were.  According to the Vegas opening moneyline consensus, the Yankees had an average wina probability of 65.6% when Cole pitched in 2021 and sometimes as high as 80%.  Seven times throughout the season, our model at GameWagers found positive edge betting against the Yankees when Cole was on the mound.  At first glance, it seems counterintuitive to bet against a name like Cole, so we looked into it and found evidence that our model was in fact correctly finding games to pick against Cole. During last season, our GameWagers model went 3-4 taking the moneyline against Cole for a positive return of 1.4 units (2% ROI).

The first thing that stands out is that the Yankees only won 53.3% of the games that Cole started in 2021 even though their opening line win probability hovered around 65%. Although surprising, these numbers alone don’t provide any information about a bettor’s net return, so we looked at the opening line for every game Cole started and calculated the return given you only took the opposing team and separately given you had only taken the Yankees.  

Assuming a consistent $100 bet placed on each game, if a bettor took the opposing team facing Cole in all 30 starts, you’d come out ahead +8.3 units.  On the other hand, had a bettor only taken the Yankees during all of Coles 31 starts, you’d have finished -5.2 units.  Your typical sports bettor probably is not taking every single game Cole pitched, but we’d also find it surprising to know that the average sports bettor took as many as 7 games against Cole in a single season like our GameWagers model.

To dig deeper into whether this was a one off for an elite pitcher like Cole, we also looked into Clayton Kershaw, Max Scherzer and Jacob deGrom for their 2021 starts and actually found a slightly positive return for these star pitchers.  In fact, had you taken every regular season game that these four pitchers started (including Cole), you’d have finished +4 units over 97 games for an ROI of 4.46% and had you taken the opposing team in all 97 games you’d have finished -9 units. For both Scherzer and deGrom, the evidence shows that the Vegas money was actually undervaluing their starts.
