This tutorial gives an example of how to use OpenPose for tracking pitcher and batter mechanics in Major League Baseball. In the first example, we see a video of Walker Beuhler.  Rather than go through video one by one, coaches and players can use tracking like this to better align hundreds of videos containing pitches all at once.
