**Methodology** - The probabilities are calculated from the results of running 1 million simulations of the 2024 season.  Inputs into the simulation are derived from up-to-date Vegas odds, team schedules, and historical NFL data.  Following each week, the full simulation runs for refreshed odds.  

For questions, comments, suggestions, or access to the data, please reach out to Drew or Danny.
