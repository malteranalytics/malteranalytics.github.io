***Betting Tips***
* The Eagles have great Super Bowl value was +1400.  Our forecast predicts they have a 1/12.5 chance
* For a dark horse Super Bowl pick, the Falcons at +3000 also has great value, in large part because they have >50% chance to win their division and earn at least 1 home playoff game
* The Browns to make the playoffs at +145 is great value for a team with a 42.9% chance, despite a challenging division
* The Rams to win their division at +350 has slight edge given their 22.9% probability to take the NFC West.  All 31 other division winner bets have negative edge.
