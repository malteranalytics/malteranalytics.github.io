This post follows through instructions for using [YOLO](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/){:target="_blank"} (You Only Look Once) with video object detection.  This demonstration was done with a g3.8xlarge Deep Learning AMI (Ubuntu) Version 6.0 (ami-bc09d9c1). The weights for this particular YOLO model were trained on the [COCO](http://cocodataset.org/#home){:target="_blank"} dataset, which consists of 182 different labels.

## Requirements ##

- Python 3.5 or 3.6
- TensorFlow
- openCV

## GitHub Repo ##

- Download the GitHub repo from [https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow](https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow){:target="_blank"}. Further instructions for downloading specific sets of weights can be found on the README file of the repo.

## Build the Library ##
- Create a build folder from the location of the repo with the following command

```python
cd darkflow
python setup.py build_ext â€”inplace
```

- Create a new folder called 'bin' within the darkflow directory and place the weights into the bin folder.
  
## Processing a Video ##

The below code assumes a video called video1.mp4 is uploaded in a data folder. You will also need to make sure that you have the proper cfg and weight files in the respective folders. In this case, the model that I am using is yolo.cfg and yolov2.weights.

If using CPU, you can get rid of the GPU flag any the threshold can be changed or removed. For a 1 minute video on a g3.8xlarge machine, it took roughly 10 minutes for the video to fully complile at a rate of 3.04 frames per second.

```python
python flow --model cfg/yolo.cfg --load bin/yolov2.weights --demo data/video1.mp4 --threshold 0.25 --gpu 1.0 --saveVideo
```
