    "body": "2024/08/19 - The Paris Olympics featured 328 events across 45 disciplines, with 92 different nations bringing home medals.  Here, we will use data to recap the games and to analyze the several factors that correlate with Olympic success, such as population, GDP, geography, and more.  We’ll also explore insights about which regions of the world succeed in each type of sports and which countries are exceptional in womens’ sport. The first chart below shows the top 12 countries in medals with a break down of each medal.  The United States led the world in gold, silver, and bronze; and with a total of 123 medals, and earned medals in roughly one-third of all events.  The map below represents the number of medals won across the world.  While each continent had podium representation, we’ll later look at specific types of sports that different regions of the world succeed in.  The next plot explains the effect that a nation’s population has on their success in the Olympics.  Outliers removed, the correlation of the below plot is 0. 6 (R2 = 0. 35), which means about one-third of the variance of medal counts can be explained by population, leaving two-thirds up to other possible variables.  If Olympic success is measured on a per capita basis, the top nations would be Grenada, Dominica, and Saint Lucia.  The below chart shows the ratio of the number of medals per 1 million population of each country.  Among the 13 nations with at least 20 medals, New Zealand has by far the lowest population at about 5 million.  The next graph demonstrates that GDP is an even greater predictor of Olympic success than population.  Outliers removed, the correlation of this plot is . 8 (R2 = 0. 62), confirming a very strong connection between medal count and GDP.  Countries that vastly outperformed their GDP are Kenya, Cuba, and Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.  The next chart looks at the percent of a country’s medals that were won in women sports, among countries that won at least 7 medals.  While a small sample size of medals for several countries leave us unable to draw a definitive conclusion, these percentages possibly give indication into what counties could be leading the way in encouraging in and or investing in womens’ sports.  Bulgaria won 10 medals, 8 of which in women’s events.  The United States also ranks near the top of the list with 59% of 123 medals going to female athletes.  Finally, the last series of maps breaks down the medal count across the world among specific Olympic sport categories.  This gives some insight into which geographic regions tend to excel in which types of sports.  The categories that sports are broken into are Artistic Exercise, Boat, Martial Arts and Combat, Endurance and Exercise, Extreme Sports, Horse, Precision Sports, Racket Sports, Speed and Athletics, Strength Sports, Swimming, and Team Sports.  The individual sports that fall into each category are laid out with each chart. Artistic Exercise: Gymnastics, Rhythmic Gymnastics, Diving, Trampolining, and Break Dancing Boat Sports: Canoe Slalom, Canoe Sprint, Rowing, and Sailing Martial Arts &amp; Combat Sports: Fencing, Judo, Karate, Taekwondo, Boxing, Wrestling Endurance and Exercise Sports: Track (&gt;= 800 meters), Marathon, Triathlon, Cycling Extreme Sports: BMX freestyle, BMX racing, Mountain Biking, Skateboarding, Climbing, Surfing, Wing Surfing Horse Sports: Equestrian Dressage, Equestrian Eventing Precision Sports: Archery, Shooting, Golf Racket Sports: Tennis, Badminton, Table Tennis Speed and Athletics: Track (&lt;=400 meters), Decathlon, High Jump, Triple Jump, Long Jump, Pole Vault, Heptathlon Strength Sports: Weightlifting, Discus Throw, Hammer Throw, Shotput, Javelin Throw Swimming: All indoor swimming events, open water long distance swimming Team Sports: Basketball, Field Hockey, Soccer, Volleyball, Beach Volleyball, Rugby Sevens, Handball, Water Polo "

    "title": "2023 NBA Draft Scouting Report",
    "body": "2023/06/26 - The NBA has extremely high expectations for the 2023 draft class, led by French phenom Victor Wembanyama.  However, it’s not just the 7’2” generational prospect that fans and coaches are looking forward to this upcoming season.  The wide range of talent has plenty of teams excited and optimistic about their future.  For the 9 lottery picks that played NCAA men’s basketball, we’ve taken snapshots from our custom advanced analytics scouting report to get a feel for what we might expect out of each player’s rookie season. Note about the data: This data has been captured from ESPN. com for NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball games.  Therefore, we only have scouting reports available for drafted NCAA players.  Also, about 70% of NCAA men’s basketball games have available shot location data on ESPN.  While some data is missing, these heat map charts serve as close representations for each player for the entire season. Notes about the graphs: Heat Map: This shows a player’s shooting percentage from each part of the court, where data is available.  Red refers to above NCAA D1 average and blue is below average.  Effective Field Goal Percentage (eFG%) refers to a weighted field goal percentage that gives 3-point shots a 50% heavier weight than 2-point shots. Full Season Stats: Averages are provided followed by the players percentile within all NCAA D1 men’s basketball. Points Differential Per 40 Minutes: A team’s net point differential standardized per 40 minutes of game time while each player is on or off the court, throughout the season. Team Time to Shoot: This chart breaks the 30 second shot clock into 5 second buckets, showing the percentage of shots that are taken within each bucket, for a sense of the team’s pace of play. Five Minute Buckets: These charts break the 40 minute games into 5 minute consecutive buckets, showing how a player’s trends throughout the game for each respective statistic. Shooting After Offensive Rebounds: Chart on left shows who shoots within 5 seconds after the a team gets an offensive rebound.  Chart on right shows what happens within 5 seconds after the given player gets an offensive rebound. Top 3 Assists by Player: This chart shows who a player gets most assists to and from throughout the season. Scouting Reports: For comments and suggestions, please reach out to danmalter@gmail. com and abmalter12@gmail. com Pick 2: Charlotte Hornets select Brandon Miller, Alabama Brandon Miller shined from both wing 3-point locations this season and sits near the top percentile in just about every statistical category.  Above his great individual stats however, is that Alabama had over a 14 point per 40-minute boost with Miller on the court compared to when he was off the court.  Pick 6: Orlando Magic select Anthony Black, Arkansas Anthony Black doesn’t stand out as a notably great shooter but does it all well.  He is an excellent defender, can get to the rim to score, and is a great passer.  Arkansas was a below average team without him on the court, as he gave his team a near 10-point swing while playing.  As Arkansas’ point guard this season, he also liked to play as a fast pace as about 60% of possessions his team got a shot off in the first 15 seconds of the shot clock.   Pick 8: Indiana Pacers select Jarace Walker, Houston There are two words to describe Jarace Walker: effective and clutch.  He’s a more conservative shooter than other stars around the NCAA, but his effective field goal percentage matches that of Brandon Miller.  He can score from anywhere on the court and is arguably more valuable on defense.  Amazingly, in the last 5 minutes of games, his 2-point shooting percentage sits over 80%, making him one of the best closers in men’s college basketball this season.  Pick 9: Utah Jazz select Taylor Hendricks, UCF Playing for a smaller school, we unfortunately are not able to get as much shooting location data on Hendricks, but what we do know is that he is completely dominant with the ball down low.  He also comes away with a ton of blocks and UCF is a completely different team with him on the court vs off the court.  Pick 10: Oklahoma City Thunder select Carson Wallace, Kentucky Looking at Carson Wallace’s 5-minute bucket stats for both points and steals, you can see he comes out of the gates on fire, both to start the game and to start the second half.  He also turns a gear back up in the final 5 minutes of play but has inconstant trends throughout the rest of the game.  He’s among the top in the nation in both assists and steals, and for a guard does an excellent job scoring in the paint.   Pick 11: Orlando Magic select Jett Howard, Michigan Son of 19-year NBA veteran and Michigan coach Juwan Howard, Jett stands out as an effective scorer, great passer, sharp 3-point shooter, and someone who comes out of the gates hot.  Michigan, however, played better this season with Jett off the court than on.  Pick 12: Dallas Mavericks select Derrick Lively II, Duke While not much of a scorer for Duke this season, big man Derrick Lively was a force down low in the paint on both sides of the ball.  His almost 2 and a half blocks per game were among the top in men’s college basketball this season, and his ability to rebound and give his team second chance points made him a nightmare for opponents.  He works well with point guards, as Duke’s guards Roach and Proctor fed him assists often and he was able to feed Roach back.  Despite his only 5 points per game and lack of shooting anywhere outside of the rim, Duke had an amazing 17-point positive swing per 40 minutes with Lively on the court, making him one of the most valuable men’s college basketball players in the country.   Pick 13: Toronto Raptors select Grady Dick, Kansas Sharpshooter Grady Dick gave NCAA’s toughest conference, the Big 12, a lot of problems this year, with an effective field goal percentage of 55%, his shooting ability around the court makes him incredibly difficult to guard.  He stays consistent throughout the game and gave Kansas a major boost while on the court.   Pick 14: New Orleans Pelicans select Jordan Hawkins, UConn Another great shooter, Jordan Hawkins was consistent and effective with the ball all season long.  He was deadly from 3, can get to the rim, and his shooting helped lead UConn to a national championship.  "

    "title": "Bettor and Vegas Bias Towards Gerrit Cole",
    "body": "2022/04/19 - There’s no doubt that Gerrit Cole is an elite pitcher playing for a great team, the New York Yankees.  He finished second in the AL Cy Young award in 2021 with a 3. 23 ERA, however, Vegas bettors seemed to think that the Yankees were a better team with Cole on the mound than they really were.  According to the Vegas opening moneyline consensus, the Yankees had an average win probability of 65. 6% when Cole pitched in 2021 and sometimes a win probability as high as 80%.  Seven times throughout the season, our model at Game Wagers found positive edge betting against the Yankees when Cole was on the mound.  At first glance, it seems counterintuitive to bet against a name like Cole, so we analyzed our picks and found that our Game Wagers model had positive return against Cole. The first thing that stands out is that the Yankees only won 53. 3% of the games that Cole started in 2021 even though their opening line win probability hovered around 65%. Although surprising, these numbers alone don’t provide any information about a bettor’s net return, so we looked at the opening line for every game Cole started and calculated the return given you only took the opposing team and separately given you had only taken the Yankees. Assuming a consistent $100 bet placed on each game, if a bettor took the opposing team facing Cole in all 30 starts, you’d come out ahead +8. 5 units.  On the other hand, had a bettor only taken the Yankees during all of Coles 31 starts, you’d have finished -5. 2 units.  Your typical sports bettor probably is not taking every single game Cole pitched, but we’d also find it surprising to know that the average sports bettor took as many as 7 games against Cole in a single season like our Game Wagers model did. To dig deeper into whether this was a one off for an elite pitcher, we also looked into Clayton Kershaw, Max Scherzer and Jacob deGrom for their 2021 starts and found a positive return.  In fact, had you taken every regular season game that these four pitchers started (including Cole), you’d have finished +4. 3 units over 97 games for an ROI of 4. 46% and had you taken the opposing team in all 97 games you’d have finished -8. 9 units. For both Scherzer and deGrom, the evidence shows that the Vegas money was actually undervaluing their starts. For more information about our MLB betting model, check out Game Wagers or reach out and we’ll answer any questions. With over thousands of lines of code, 100% of our picks are from an automated machine learning model and we continue to show success so far into the 2022 season.

    "title": "An Application of Unsupervised Machine Learning: What Each Team Should Focus on Heading into the NBA Playoffs",
    "body": "2022/04/07 - The 20 NBA teams that will compete in the playoffs and play-in games have been set, each with their own unique abilities and vulnerabilities.  A game style that works for one team could very well be the demise of another.  Aside from the obvious (i. e. - shooting better, defending better), I’ve dug into NBA Advanced Tracking data to identify coachable and manageable actions that each team can take to improve their chances of heading into the off-season as champions. The first plot introduces many of the data features that may end up being focus points for playoff teams.  Other than points and assists, these are all metrics that don’t show up in a box score, yet metrics that coaches and scouts care about.  The data is measured on a per-game basis and the purpose of the matrix is to understand the correlation between how teams fair for each metric with scoring and winning.  For example, there is a positive correlation of 0. 38 between how well a team boxes out and winning games.  Conversely, and perhaps counter intuitively, the cumulative distance traveled by the players on a team is inversely correlated to winning.  Do winning teams reduce movement to save energy? Do losing teams find themselves running around more because they’re struggling to run offensive plays or keep up with their opponents? There’s a lot to the story that this correlation plot doesn’t share with us, so we’ll dig deeper into the data to learn more.  Below is the first look at how some teams succeed by doing something intuitively good, in this case passing more, yet other teams are doing just fine without passing much.  The teams on the x-axis are ranked in order of record as of April 5.  The Suns have the best record in the NBA, yet they pass less than just about every team as well.  We also see two of the highest passing teams, the Warriors and Pacers, falling on opposite sides of the win spectrum.  Looking at the next chart, we see that there’s a variation across the league of about a half dribble per player touch, which is significant when you extrapolate the number of touches throughout a game (Around 400 touches per game is standard).  We see both good and bad teams that do a lot of dribbling, and visa versa.  While a lot of dribbling and little passing fits the Suns system well, perhaps a team like the Trailblazers could benefit from dribbling less and passing more.  Moving forward, there does seem to be at least a small connection between good teams and posting up, despite some of the best teams not using the post up often.  To no surprise, the Nuggets and 76ers dominate this area of basketball with Nikola Jokic and Joel Embiid on the court.  On the contrary, the Grizzlies have shown that there are other ways to be effective on offense.  In the case of the Grizzlies with the following chart, it turns out that they still get the ball in the paint almost as much as any other team, with the driving abilities of Ja Morant leading the way for them.  In almost completely opposite fashion, the 76ers rarely drive and therefor have fewer paint touches than the rest of the league, despite Embiid’s amazing post-up ability.  Another key offensive strategy for some teams is getting the ball to the elbow.  Like the previous metrics, this strategy is very dependent on player personnel, and hence varies across the spectrum of good and bad teams.  As the below chart shows, the cumulative distance traveled among each team’s players per game is another interesting metric.  The Hornets and Spurs move more than any other team yet are playing play-in games.  The Celtics are the most successful team that minimizes movement.  Later, we’ll see a breakdown for teams’ movement between offense and defense which will provide more insight.  Finally, we’ll look at the breakdown of boxing out by team.  Good teams don’t necessarily box out more than bad teams, but as it not surprisingly turns out, when teams box out more often with respect to themselves, they win more games as well.  Having a better understanding of the data behind the box score, let’s now look at each playoff team to look for patterns when they are winning games compared to losing games.  While the tables may not give the complete story as to why the trend is apparent, some useful insights can be determined by supplementing this information with what we know about the team’s personnel and strategies. Western Conference: Phoenix Suns: The Suns have a small sample size of losses, but from those 16 games we can see that their defensive movement is down by almost half a mile per game and they’re getting the ball in the paint 4 times less per game.  From what we saw last year in their run as the Western Conference champions, I would expect the same high intensity defense to show up for them again in this year’s playoffs.  Memphis Grizzlies: Simply put, the Grizzlies are extremely tough to beat when they’re possessing the ball, getting more touches and dribbling (allowing Ja Morant to take over games).  They’re most vulnerable when they rush and aren’t passing well.  There can be plenty of theories of cause and effect, but it’s interesting to see that when they win, they generally have much less offensive movement.  Golden State Warriors: The Warriors just need to stay true to themselves.  They didn’t win championships by playing big and the post up game hasn’t been what’s driving their success this year either.  Dallas Mavericks: While one of the West’s best teams, there’s not much statistically significant insight here for Dallas.  On a small scale, their wins come from games in which they move the ball around more and get the ball into the paint.  Denver Nuggets: For the best post up team in the NBA, it’s essential for the Nuggets to be getting Jokic the ball down low.  The Nuggets also utilize the ball well from the elbow and have slightly more defensive movement for their wins.  Utah Jazz: The Jazz 46 wins look almost identical to their 32 losses, with slightly more paint and elbow touches when they’re winning games.  Minnesota Timberwolves: Passing, possessing, and getting more touches hasn’t correlated to Timberwolves success, but offensive movement has a slightly positive correlation with winning games for them.  LA Clippers: Like the Timberwolves, passing and possessing more hasn’t been the answer for the Clippers, and their only positive distinction here would be with post ups.  New Orleans Pelicans: While the Pelicans have a larger sample size of losses than wins, their wins are coming from games where they’re passing more and getting some more touches both at the elbow and in the paint.  San Antonio Spurs: The final play-in team in the West will give themselves the best shot to compete if they can get the ball down low, both from the post up game and allowing their guards to drive.  Eastern Conference: Miami Heat: For the best regular season team in the East, the Heat play better when they’re not overpassing.  They also are at their best when they’re getting the ball down low and are possessing on offense.  Boston Celtics: One of the hottest teams in the NBA, the Celtics move significantly less than most teams.  Yet their losses often come when they’re not moving well, even for their own standards.  Milwaukee Bucks: Not surprisingly, the Bucks are one of the best teams in the NBA when they can get the ball in the paint.  Otherwise, their wins and losses don’t have a ton of variation among the other metrics.  Philadelphia 76ers: Like the Nuggets, the unsurprising key to victory for the 76ers is using their MVP big man to their advantage.  When they get Embiid the ball down low, they’re in great shape.  Toronto Raptors: The Raptors are significantly better when they are passing more and possessing more.  For them, it’s not about working the ball low or to the elbow, if they are moving the ball around well on offense.  Chicago Bulls: There’s no glaring stand out for the Bulls here, but they do have almost half a mile more in movement on average when they win versus when they lose.  They average an extra paint touch per game when they win, yet fewer passes and touches for their wins as well and their time of possession doesn’t change for wins or losses.  Cleveland Cavaliers: The Cavaliers can look like two completely different teams between their wins and losses.  Winning for them means getting the ball down low significantly more often and passing more, getting each player more touches.  Brooklyn Nets: As a scary play-in team that can make some noise, the Nets are great working the ball to the elbow and are passing the ball almost 15 times more per game when they win vs when they lose.  If they’re possessing on offense and sharing the ball, they can be tough to beat.  Atlanta Hawks: Another team that struggles when they aren’t passing, ball movement and possession are two key factors for the Hawks to focus on heading into the playoffs.  They also play well from the elbow, and their down low game doesn’t change much between wins and losses.  Charlotte Hornets: A team that moves a ton both on offense and defense, they can tire opponents out and win games when they’re moving well, even by their own standards.  They can also slightly benefit from holding onto the ball longer and not rushing their decision making on offense.

    "title": "Can NBA Teams Stay Competitive on a Low Budget?",
    "body": "2022/02/22 - With the NBA All-Star weekend now behind us, it’s a great time for basketball fans to reflect on the exciting 2021-22 season so far.  Notably, several teams have thus far drastically improved in the standings compared to last season, including the Bulls, Heat, Grizzlies, Cavs, and Timberwolves.  Success for some of these teams is partially due to increased player payrolls, however other teams are thriving with lower salaried rosters.  The extent to which a team can compete on a low budget depends on many factors, including draft lottery luck, but this season’s All Star break standings might prove that budget can’t guarantee wins and losses. To set the stage, the chart below shows a distribution of NBA player salaries in the 2021-22 season.  Most players in the league make between $1-$5 million and two-thirds of starters are making over $5 million, with a max salary just under $46 million held by Steph Curry.  55 players, an average of about 2 players per team, are making at least $20 million.  With an NBA minimum at $558,000, just 16 players on a full season contract are making less than $1 million, one of which being the Bulls notable rookie, Ayo Dosunmo, at $925,258.  The next chart looks at the sum of salaries on the court at any given time for a 5-player lineup.  220 distinct 5-player lineups were analyzed, on the condition that the lineup has played together for at least 48 minutes of game time this season. For example, the two most common lineups that Bulls coach Billy Donovan has used this season are DeRozen, Vucevic, LaVine, Ball, Green at 152 minutes and DeRozen, Vucevic, LaVine, Green, Dosunmu at 127 minutes.  In all, 10 unique combinations of 5 players have been on the court at the same time for the Bulls for at least 48 minutes so far this season. Generally, many NBA team’s 5-player lineups add up to somewhere between $50-$80 million in salary.  At the extremes, the Warriors have routinely used the most expensive lineup worth about $125 million and 46 lineups with combined salaries less than that of Steph Curry’s $46 million have hit the 48-minute threshold as well.  In order to determine the connection between total salary and success, I’ve used the NBA advanced metric Net Rating as an objective measure.  This value represents the net points (positive or negative) scored while a set of players are on the court together per 100 possessions.  A team who wins a game by 5 points that featured 100 offensive and defensive possessions will have a Net Rating of +5. While there are other metrics that better predict future success and win/loss records, Net Rating serves as a simple and concrete description of ‘what happened?’ while a given lineup was out on the court.  A notable flaw of the metric, however, is that is does not account for who the team is playing against.  In a future analysis, I would potentially try alternative other evaluations of success. Before analyzing the Net Rating and Salary relationships in our data, we’ll first look at the top 10 highest and lowest salaried lineups thus far this season, among lineups that have played 48 minutes together.  The Warriors and Bucks have played the most expensive lineups and are having great seasons, however the Warrior’s $126 million lineup of Curry, Thompson, Wiggins, Looney, and Kuminga is negative in their 58 minutes on the court.  On the other hand, the 76ers have an incredibly inexpensive lineup that has played great together in their 67 minutes. Top 10 Highest Paid 5-Player Lineups in 2021-22 Season Top 10 Lowest Paid 5-Player Lineups in 2021-22 Season The next two tables display the top 10 and bottom 10 lineups by Net Rating.  With Luka Doncic on the final year of his rookie contract, the Mavericks have an extremely low salaried lineup as one of the best in the league.  The Knicks, Trailblazers, and Heat additionally have inexpensive, yet successful lineups.  Conversely, Sacramento has an above average priced lineup that is struggling in their 51 minutes together, but typically the low performing lineups with significant minutes together are also on the lower end of the salary spectrum. Top 10 Highest Net Rating (NETRTG) 5-Player Lineups in 2021-22 Season First Half Top 10 Lowest Net Rating (NETRTG) 5-Player Lineups in 2021-22 Season First Half In the below chart, we can see a definitive uphill relationship between Net Rating and lineup salary among the most used lineups, although there seems to be little to no relationship between the two variables among more infrequently used lineups.  In these cases, it is just as likely that an inexpensive lineup will succeed as will an expensive lineup.  Perhaps the expensive lineups that are performing poorly are getting less minutes together throughout the season, while inexpensive lineups that are outperforming expectations are getting more minutes than otherwise expected.  The next two charts break down Net Rating by offense and defense and tell an interesting story of their own.  Just like the overall Net Rating, offensive ratings are well correlated with lineup salaries, especially among the most used lineups.  We can also see that defensive ratings have virtually zero correlation with lineup salaries.  There are just an many inexpensive, yet successful defensive lineups as there are expensive defensive lineups, inferring that NBA players get paid for their offensive abilities far more than their defensive abilities.  As we’ll see later, the clever teams are very much aware of this notion and are taking advantage of it accordingly.  The next series of charts break down which teams each of the lineups represent for Net Ratings, Offensive Ratings, and Defensive Ratings.  To avoid overcrowding, the charts have been split by Eastern Conference and Western Conference. In the East, a glaring takeaway is that the Knicks have some very successful lineups at inexpensive costs, as Rose, Gibson, Burks, Toppin, and Quickly have produced a +29 rating in 89 minutes.  Ironically their most expensive lineup with Burks, Fournier, Noel, Randle, and Barrett is sitting at a Net Rating of -20 from 63 minutes of court time.  It’s possible, though, that the more expensive lineup is going up against more expensive and better opponent lineups, thus deflating their Net Rating.  The Cavs and Hornets also show up well in the quadrant of low salaries and high Net Ratings; the latter can be attributed in large part to the star play of LaMello Ball, who sits on his rookie contract of just about $8 million.  Conversely, the Pacers are considerably underperforming this season relative to the salaries of their lineups.  From the defensive chart, the Cavs are clearly the most successful low-budget team in the East.  While their offense is solid but doesn’t necessarily stand out among the rest of the league, we can see that their strong defense likely holds a lot of weight towards their standing of being tied for 3rd in the conference.  Additionally, while the Bulls aren’t in the low-budget category that the Cavs are in, and they are spending more this season than they did last season, they are also showing strong defensive numbers that out project expectations and have led to a successful first half.  In the Western Conference, the Warriors, Suns, Jazz, and Nuggets are all spending a ton of money, but are seeing positive results to show for it.  The Grizzlies and Mavericks are successful teams playing off low salaries, both with breakout superstars on rookie contracts, Ja Morant and Luka Doncic.  Contrarily, the Lakers are far underperforming expectations with their high payroll, and the Clippers and Trailblazers both have wide variance of successful and costly lineups that put them in all four quadrants.   As the prior 6 charts suggest, NBA success weighs not only on the amount of money a team spends, but the way in which they spend their money and manage their rosters in gameplay.  Although it would be nearly impossible for a team resembling the Piston’s payroll to compete at the same level as a team resembling the Warrior’s payroll, roster development strategies certainly play a role in fluctuations between expected results and actual results.  No team can be ruled out of playoff hopes simply based on their total salary spend, and it doesn’t take being in the top ranks of total payroll to consider yourself a championship contender, either.

    "title": "Special Teams Edge",
    "body": "2022/01/06 - With the growing prevalence of analytics in the NFL and the playoffs right around the corner, it’s more important than ever for teams to give themselves every statistical edge possible to win games.  Offensive play calling and game management have noticeably changed in the era of analytics, but an area of the game that is still relatively immature with analytics is Special Teams.  Using NFL data from the 2018-2020 seasons, we can begin to think about how to manage Special Teams in order to maximize yardage both on the punting and returning sides of the ball. Let’s begin with the chart below that shows the correlation of several numeric variables within the punt game.  The resulting play yardage is the key variable that teams want to focus on.  This is the net distance between the yard line the punting team began on and the yard line the returning team finishes the play on.  No surprise here as punt length and hang time are the two most correlated variables that the punting team can control.  Snap time and the time it takes for the punter to handle the football are both statistically insignificant since there is little variation for these metrics across the league.  However, it’s intuitive that a quicker snap would lead to a better punt due to more time for the punter, and a rushed punter operation could also lead to a worse punt.  While the above correlation matrix doesn’t particularly teach us anything that teams don’t already know, the below visuals could potentially offer punters and coaches a usable strategy.  On average, punts to the left result in an extra one net yard per play for the punting team compared to center, and punts to the right result in an extra two yards per play compared to center.  We can dive deeper into net yardage by looking at return direction as well.  The table following the below graph shows the net yardage by punt direction and return direction, with a proceeding visual to demonstrate the results.   The general idea from the above diagram shows that the optimal punt strategy is to punt towards a sideline and force the returner center or to the side.  This strategy runs the risk of punting out of bounds and losing yardage, but due to the top talent of NFL punters, this strategy still gives the best results on average. However, if you punt to the sideline and allow the returner to get towards the middle, you are now at a greater disadvantage than if you just punted center. When it comes to Special Teams personnel, it’s often thought of that the punters and the returners are the two most important players on the field.  As the below four charts show, the gunners (punt team players who specialize in running down the returner) and the vises (the return team players who attempt to prevent the gunners from running down the returner) play a much larger role.  Note that the variation in return yards among the top gunners and vises ranges from an average of about 10 yards per punt.  Meanwhile, the variation in return and punt yards among the top returners and punters is just about 5 yards per punt.  With returners, there are occasionally outlying superstars, such as Devin Hester or in 2020, Gunner Olscewski, but the difference between top tier and bottom tier NFL punters is much more insignificant.   If teams can optimize punt strategy and player personnel, significantly better results can be achieved.  The chart below shows the expected points per drive depending on where a drive begins.  Every 5 yards corresponds to about 0. 25 less expected points per drive.  In a game where a team punts four times, five additional yards per punt can save the team a full expected point on defense.  While Special Teams and punting is just one of many aspects of a football game, taking these statically optimal steps can be the difference between winning and losing a close game.  "

    "title": "Analyzing Success in the 2021 Olympics",
    "body": "2021/08/17 - The Tokyo Olympics featured 339 events across 50 disciplines, with 93 different nations bringing home medals.  Using data can allow us to dissect the several factors that correlate with Olympic success, such as population, GDP, geography, and more.  The below series of charts show many insights such as which regions of the world succeed in which types of sports, which countries are exceptional in women’s sports, and to what extent population and GDP predict a nation’s success. The first chart below shows the top 12 medaling countries with a break down of each medal.  The United States led the world in gold, silver, and bronze; and with a total of 113 medals, medaled in roughly one-third of all events.  The map below represents the number of medals won across the world.  While each continent had podium representation, we’ll later look at specific types of sports that different regions of the world succeed in.  The plot below explains the effect that a nation’s population has on their success in the Olympics.  Outliers removed, the correlation of the below plot is 0. 6 (R2 = 0. 35), which means about one-third of the variance of medal counts can be explained by population, leaving two-thirds up to other possible variables.  If Olympic success is measured on a per capita basis, the top nations would be San Marino, Bermuda, and Grenada.  The below chart shows the ratio of the number of medals per 1 million population of each country.  Among the 15 nations with at least 20 medals, New Zealand has by far the lowest population at under 5 million.  The next chart below shows that GDP is an even greater predictor of Olympic success than population.  Outliers removed, the correlation of this plot is . 8 (R2 = 0. 62), demonstrating a very strong connection between medal count and GDP.  Countries that vastly outperformed their GDP are Kenya, Cuba, and Ukraine.  The next chart looks at the percent of a country’s medals that were won in women sports, among countries that won at least 4 medals.  While a small sample size of medals for several countries leave us unable to draw a definitive conclusion, these percentages potentially give indication into what counties could be leading the way in encouraging in and or investing in women’s sports.  Bulgaria won 6 medals, all in women’s events.  The United States also ranks near the top of the list with 63% of 113 medals going to female athletes.  As expected, most counties fall within a few percentage points up or down from 50%.  The last series of maps breaks down the medal count across the world among specific Olympic sport categories.  This gives some insight into which geographic regions tend to excel in which types of sports.  The categories that sports are broken into are Artistic Exercise, Boat, Combat, Endurance, Cycling, Extreme Sports, Horse, Martial Arts, Precision Sports, Racket Sports, Speed and Athletics, Strength Sports, Swimming, and Team Sports.  The individual sports that fall into each category are laid out with each chart. Artistic Exercise: Gymnastics, Rhythmic Gymnastics, Diving, and Trampolining Boat Sports: Canoe Slalom, Canoe Sprint, Rowing, and Sailing Combat Sports: Boxing, Wrestling Endurance Sports: Track (&gt;= 800 meters), Marathon, Triathlon Cycling: Cycling Road, Cycling Track Extreme Sports: BMX freestyle, BMX racing, Mountain Biking, Skateboarding, Climbing, Surfing Horse Sports: Equestrian Dressage, Equestrian Eventing Martial Arts: Fencing, Judo, Karate, Taekwondo Precision Sports: Archery, Shooting, Golf Racket Sports: Tennis, Badminton, Table Tennis Speed and Athletics: Track (&lt;=400 meters), Decathlon, High Jump, Triple Jump, Long Jump, Pole Vault, Heptathlon Strength Sports: Weightlifting, Discus Throw, Hammer Throw, Shotput, Javelin Throw Swimming: All indoor swimming events, open water long distance swimming Team Sports: Basketball, Field Hockey, Soccer, Volleyball, Beach Volleyball, Softball, Baseball, Rugby Sevens, Handball, Water Polo "

    "title": "Using AI with MLB Video to Detect Changes in Mechanics",
    "body": "2021/06/08 - Major League Baseball’s Statcast has done a lot to improve how player’s movements are analyzed, but little public research has been done using video and image processing to improve mechanics of players and to help prevent injuries.  In part, this is due to the fact that machine learning related to images and videos requires lots of storage and high computing.  Even though storage and computing are relatively cheap, there is a small cost and high complexity associated to performing data science on this type of data, which creates a barrier to entry working with it. Additionally, MLB and individual teams own video rights making accessibility of data difficult. In this article, I will demonstrate how sample image and video data can be used in different ways to help MLB’s pitchers improve various actions, such as their mechanics, prevent future injuries, detect changes in arm movement throughout a game, as well as some other use cases.  All of the concepts shown below can be used at a larger scale to make more significant impacts.  Implementation of work uses a combined method of MIT’s open-source algorithm, OpenPose, as well as various data analysis and machine learning techniques.  Further information about OpenPose can be seen here. An example of the final algorithm in action is shown below. Walker Buehler Side View Data Capture: Data for this project was captured by collecting various video clips of a given player from both a side and center field point of view.  All video and images used in this analysis are solely for a research purpose and are not being used for any team specifically.  However, a team can utilize this method of analysis by having a still camera directed at a pitcher throughout a game or during a bullpen/batting practice session.  For the most part, the infrastructure is already in place, so it comes down to a matter of teams collecting and utilizing this type of data.  For simplicity of this analysis, a few different pitches/swings were collected for a small sample of players, but the ideal situation would be to have hundreds of pitches or swings to gain better insights from the data. OpenPose captures data for 25 keypoints of a human body, such as “Right Wrist”, “Neck”, “Left Knee”, etc. for both still images and videos.  A mapping of the keypoints to human body part can be seen in Image 1.  For each image fed through the algorithm, the x-coordinates, y-coordinates and confidence (0-1) are given for each of the 25 keypoints (body parts).  If the algorithm is applied to a video, then the video is essentially broken up into many separate images.                Image 1: OpenPose keypoints    Analysis: To start, we’ll look at a still image of the OpenPose algorithm applied to a side view of Walker Buehler throwing a pitch.  When a keypoint cannot be found in the image, OpenPose uses machine learning to estimate where the body part is located, which is referred to as pose estimation.  These cases can happen when a body part is hidden from view in the image or video.  The OpenPose algorithm also works with one or multiple people in a single view, but I have found that it works best with only one person in the picture to reduce background noise. In cases where non-relevant people are in the background, image processing techniques such as blurring effects or cropping can be used to filter out this noise.  This article will not focus on this the preprocessing work implemented prior to running images and video through the OpenPose algorithm, but OpenCV or deep learning techniques would be appropriate for implementing background blurring effects.                Image 2: OpenPose applied to a still image of Walker Buehler    By feeding in a video through the OpenPose algorithm, we get an output like the video below.  Here we see the OpenPose algorithm in action throughout the duration of a full pitch for Walker Buehler. During this one center field view clip, 101 snapshots were taken by the algorithm.  Another way to think about this is that the video is turned into a sequence of 101 still images.  This number will differ depending on the length of a particular video.  Walker Buehler Center Field View Using the output data from each of the 101 center field view images, a plot for a given keypoint (body part) can be mapped out over time.  From a windup approach, the below chart shows an example of Buehler’s right shoulder movement over the duration of the pitch above.  As Buehler approaches the release of the ball, his shoulder drops and then picks back up as he finishes the pitch.  This is evident by simply watching the video, but the advantage of this type of analysis is that the data can pick up changes in a pitcher’s mechanics that the naked eye may not be able to see.  Additionally, given the proper data, thousands of videos can be analyzed in a matter of minutes versus spending hours of film watching.                Image 3: Walker Buehler’s right shoulder mapped out over the duration of a single pitch    Valuable information can be shown from one unique pitch, but deeper analysis can start to be made from taking multiple pitches of the same pitcher over the duration of a game or multiple appearances.  The left chart below shows an analysis from five different pitches Buehler threw over the same game.  Each clip is initiated at a slightly different time prior to Buehler starting his motion, so in order to make more meaning of these five pitches, the right chart shows the same five pitches overlayed on top of each other starting from roughly the same point in time.  The data shows that Buehler has a slightly different motion for his cutter and slider than for his four-seam fastball.  Although not evidence, this possibly can mean that Buehler is tipping his pitches as shown in the clear change in patterns. It is important to note here that the distance of the plot is measured in pixels, so in order to know how significant this difference really is to a batter, the pixels need to be converted into inches.  With technology such as MLB’s Statcast, this should not be an issue implementing into gameday data.  In this example, based on an estimated PPI (pixels per inch) of 250px, it’s estimated that difference in shoulder height distance between Buehler’s four-seam fastball versus his cutter and slider is about 0. 25 inches.                 Image 4: Walker Buehler’s right shoulder mapped out over the duration for five distinct pitches    Future Implementation: There are lots of opportunities for further research still to be done in this area, but the difficulty is having the appropriate input data.  Some options would be for MLB to release video clips of this type for research purposes or to implement this data into MLB’s open-source data as it’s own standalone data source.  Another option would be to work with teams or individual players to collect video footage during offseason training.  In regards for use cases of this data, here are a few ideas. Player Scouting:  OpenPose can be used to measure how closely one player’s pitching or hitting mechanics are relative to another known player. By collecting data like angles of body parts, movement, etc. , clustering algorithms can be used to measure the similarity between two player’s pitches or swings.  From a scouting perspective, these types of models can output something along the lines of, “Player A’s swing is 80% similar to Mike Trout”. Tracking Mechanics:  Rather than a player or coach going through video one by one, OpenPose technology can be used to better align hundreds or thousands of videos all at once. If a pitcher is unknowingly changing their mechanics, data from OpenPose can be mapped out with a time dimension, similar to the charts used for Buehler, to determine how much of a change is occurring and which body part is causing mechanics to differ. Injury Prevention:    By using this type of pitcher or batter tracking data, models like outlier detection algorithms can be used to detect if a pitcher’s mechanics are differing too much from the norm. If an outlier is detected, an alert system can be programmed to provide information to the pitcher that a significant change in their mechanics was detected and this hopefully would help to prevent a future injury.     This type of data can also be used to measure a given pitcher’s mechanics to those that have previously suffered from pitching related injuries. For example, let’s say that Pitcher A suffered from Tommy John surgery. At the start of the season, Pitcher A and Pitcher B start out with a 60% similarity in pitching mechanics. However, by the end of the season, Pitcher B’s mechanics are off and now the similarity between the two pitchers is at 90%. Perhaps this would be a red flag for Pitcher B to investigate further so that he too does not ultimately suffer from Tommy John.  Whether it be pitchers like Trevor Bauer filming their practice sessions in the off-season, batters trying to gain an advantage, or simply just trying to prevent injuries, there are lots of use cases for this type of data.  Time will tell if MLB provides this data in more readily available formats, but there is no doubt that teams can already start utilizing this type of data if they aren’t already. Example code to run the OpenPose algorithm be seen here. This example code excludes data cleaning, preprocessing and analyzing of data. "

    "body": "2021/04/07 - The 2021 Masters is underway this week and despite all the unpredictability of the tournament, golfer trends from the past several years will show which traits are most often correlated with success.  The below table shows the correlation that several variables have with a player’s performance during Master’s Weekend.  The data that feeds into this table goes back to 2015 to find golfer’s statistics between the start of each season and the tournament leading up to the Masters, as well as the rank in which the player finished in the respective Masters tournament. Because of the erratic nature of the Masters, no variable is completely reliable but the number of top 10 finishes, the previous year’s Masters rank, the season scoring average, and shots gained off the tee have noteworthy significance.  Meanwhile, shots gained on approach, around the green, and putting, have near zero correlation, because the separation of the best from the worst in these areas is less significant.  The next chart breaks down the average stats among those who finish in the top 10 in the Masters against the rest of the field.  A similar conclusion can be drawn here as in the correlation matrix.  The metrics with the greatest difference between top 10 finishers and the rest of the field imply greater predictability towards Master’s success.  The next chart shows the average rank that a golfer finishes in the Master’s, broken down by the number of top 10 finishes they have leading up to the tournament.  Unsurprisingly, the more top 10 finishes, the better the average rank despite the outlier at 7 top ten finishes.  However, only half of the best golfers with 4-6 top 10 finishes will finish in the top 25 in the Masters.  It’s often theorized that some golfer’s have the ability to bring about their best in the most intense circumstances, while others cannot pull themselves together regardless of how good they are.  The below charts show the pattern of year over year Master’s rankings, indepentant of any other variable.  The rows represent the number golfers who finished within the respective ranked bucket of 10 in a given year while the columns denote the number of golfers who finished within the respective ranked bucket of 10 in the following year.  Hence, among the 25 golfers in the study who finished in the top 10 in a given year, 9 of them finished in the top 10 in the following year.  The same chart as above can be output as percentages, like in the table below.  This table provides insight into an estimate of how many golfers from last tournament’s ranked bucket would be expected to fall into each ranked bucket for this year.  As shown, 48% of previous year top 10 golfers finished in the top 10 in the following year, and 41% of golfers who finished 60+ finished60+ again the following year.  Finally, it’s important to make clear just how unpredicatable the Masters really is, in statistical terms.  The below output is the result of running a Least-Squares Regression Model, using just the most correlated variables to predict a golfer’s Master’s rank.  While there are a lot of metrics in this output, the important one to note is the R-squared at 0. 140.  This means that just 14% of the variance in the model can be attributed to (predicted by) the variables in the model.  The other 86% of the model’s variance is just randomness.  As seen in recent years, crazy things happen in the Master’s that nobody (and no statistical model) can possibly predict.  However, if you’re looking for some slight edge in predicting your Master’s pool, the above tables would be the best thing to use.  "

    "title": "An Analytics Guide to March Madness",
    "body": "2021/03/15 - Year after year, March Madness continues to prove that data science cannot crack every code.  There’s far too much variance among the estimated 120 Billion possible ways to reasonably fill out a bracket.  Just as an AI algorithm can’t predict the result of a coin toss any better than a human being can, algorithms can only do so much when predicting a single elimination basketball tournament of 68 college teams that spread across dozens of leagues.  While analyzing tournament data won’t give you a perfect bracket, it can however slightly increase your chances of winning your bracket pool.  I’ve always believed the fun in March Madness is picking a bracket with your heart, but for the games you can’t make up your mind, maybe some data insights can sway your decision. The first set of charts below shows the percent of possible outcomes in the past 35 tournaments in which each given seed has made it to the respective round.  For example, in 35 tournaments, 1-seeds have had 70 opportunities to make it the championship game (Two teams per tournament), in which 35 times (50%) a 1 seed has played in the championship game.  You’ll see that once a one seed makes it to the final four, their chances of winning the tournament begin to increase.  Other notable takeaways are that 9 seeds beat 8 seeds slightly more than 50% of the matchups and all seeds greater than 3 have made it to the Sweet 16 less than half the time.   It can also be seen that 10, 11, and 12 seeds make it to the Sweet 16 more often than 8 and 9 seeds, even though they are presumably worse teams.  This is because 8 and 9 seeds have to play 1 seeds if they win their first game. The next chart below shows the tournament win percentages by conference in the past 35 seasons, among conferences with at least 20 cumulative tournament wins.  While ACC teams are not as well represented this year compared to years past, the ACC is historically the most successful tournament conference.  The Big 10 Conference, third in all time tournament win percentage, will be the conference to watch this March as they have the most tournament teams at 9, 4 of which are in the top 2 seeds.  Using historical March Madness patterns and 2021 season data, I’ve output the percent probabilities of each team to make it to each round.  Gonzaga is the notable favorite with a 50% chance of making the Final 4 and a 22% chance of winning the tournament.  The only other teams with greater than a 5% of winning the tournament are Gonzaga’s fellow 1 seeds, Illinois, Baylor, and Michigan.  However, the chances that a team from the rest of the field wins the tournament is still nearly 50%.  "

    "title": "Why Did the NFL See So Many More Touchdowns in the COVID-19 Season?",
    "body": "2021/01/25 - Like all sports leagues around the world, the NFL made several adjustments to their 2020 season in order to accommodate dealing with COVID-19 while still allowing games to be played.  Teams played in empty stadiums and several players throughout the league missed games and practices due to either testing positive for COVID-19 or being in contact with someone who tested positive.  Additionally, the NFL schedule had to be adjusted multiple times throughout the season; games were pushed back to later weeks or even pushed back from Sunday to sometime in the middle of the week.  In attempt to understand how these adjustments may have affected game play, I’ve compared NFL play-by-play data between the 2020 season and previous seasons. Many aspects of the NFL change year over year so it’s important to not attribute the changes we see in this analysis to COVID-19-related adjustments without statistical evidence.  Nonetheless, we will see some dramatic differences in 2020 data compared to previous seasons and seek their explanations. First, the home team won a fewer percentage of its games this season compared to any season in recent history.  This plays nicely into the theory that fans contribute to helping the home team win games.  The chart below shows the percentage of games won by the home team in the NFL over the past 5 seasons.  In 2019, the home team won just 53. 5% percent of its games, which is an adequately lower percentage than years prior.  What we don’t know is whether 2019 was an outlier year for lack of home field advantage or the trend of home field advantage was shrinking for reasons that we may not be aware of.  If the former is true, then 51% of home wins in 2020 is abnormally low.  If the latter is true, then perhaps the fans make a much smaller impact on the game than perceived and visiting NFL teams are finding better ways to deal with the obstacles that come with playing on the road.  If the NFL can fill stadiums in 2021, then we’ll have better insight into this, but based on year over year trends, my own hypothesis favors the former; that 2019 was an outlier season and the empty stadiums of 2020 did take away much of the home field advantage. In addition to the fans, the other aspect that affects home field advantage is the travel of the visiting team.  In the 2020 NFL season, elements of travel such as jet-lag, players not sleeping in their own beds, and the unfamiliar turf, remained a constant.  Having removed one known aspect of home-field advantage, we can estimate that 1. 5% of the variance of the outcomes of NFL games can be explained solely by the effects of travel. The next two charts below show another obvious change in the 2020 season; the high offensive production across the league.  This season saw an increase in points by 15% compared to the average of the previous 4 seasons.  Does crowd noise favor the defense, was there a change in offensive strategy, or perhaps a combination of both? We’ll dive deeper into offensive metrics to get a better idea.  From the chart below, we can see the driving force behind increase in points scored.  The arrows represent the yard lines in which the average NFL drive began and ended per season.  In 2020, offenses were averaging almost an additional 5 yards per drive.  The second chart below breaks down the average drive by team so that you can see how your team faired in 2020 compared to the league.  Now that it’s clear that offensive efficiency rose in 2020, we’ll break down different aspects of the offensive side of the game in order to see what changed this season and what did not.  The chart below breaks down the number of snaps per season by formation.  While there were slightly more overall snaps in the 2020 season than in prior years, the breakdown of snaps by formation remained just about the same.  Next, the chart below informs us of the percentage of snaps on each down that are pass plays compared to rush plays.  We find no statistical evidence that passing rates have changed this season.  We can also break down pass plays by regular passes against play action passes.  From the chart below, we can see that 27 of the 32 teams in the NFL had a higher average yards per play action pass than they do for pass plays in general.  However, the 2020 NFL season saw just 22. 7% of all pass plays use play action, a downward trend from 2019 and 2018, which were 26. 6% and 27. 2% respectively.  The benefit of play action is the element of surprise on the defense, which would be mitigated if overused, but NFL teams certainly should be using play action more than they currently are.  While it’s clear that formations and pass rates are not a factor in increased points this season, we finally can see a change in coaching decisions that do positively impact overall points scored.  In 2020, teams are going for it on fourth down more than they have in recent history.  Regardless of the outcome of a 4th down conversion, it almost always increases the potential for the game to have more points scored.  Either the offense gets to continue their drive on first down, or the defense gets to take over the ball in much better field position than they otherwise would have.  Another notable factor that has favored offenses in 2020 compared to prior seasons is the rate of penalties.  From the chart below, we can see that defensive penalties and penalty yards remained relatively constant in 2020, but offensive penalties and penalty yards dropped substantially.  This supports the theory that some offensive penalties such as false starts are a function of crowd noise, typically disadvantaging the visiting team.  Whatever the reasons, in 2020, offenses gained an average net positive 14 yards in penalties per game when they averaged just about 3 net positive yards in penalties per game in the previous 4 seasons.  For a better idea of when penalties occur, the below table breaks down the number of penalties in 2020 by offensive formation. Note that snaps under center are the only formation in which the offense has negative net penalty yardage.  The final piece of this analysis is to look at field goal kicking.  In 2020, the number of field goals taken and the percent of field goals made remained relatively constant with prior seasons.  In the last chart below, we can see the percent of field goals made by increments of 5 yards, comparing the 2020 and 2019 seasons.  Just as the above table shows, there were not any notable change in field goal kicking this season.  Having looked at several aspects of the game, the adjustments that the NFL made with regards to COVID-19 do seem to have affected gameplay in 2020.  To exactly what extent is still unclear, but we found sharp differences in the lack of home field advantage, increased points scored and offensive efficiency, and decreased offensive penalties while maintaining similarities in offensive play calling and field goal kicking.  The 2020 NFL season will always be remembered in a unique manner, but time will tell just how unique the statistical outcomes of the season really were. "

    "title": "UFC Fighting Analysis",
    "body": "2020/10/20 - In preparation for the highly anticipated UFC title fight between the current Men’s Lightweight champion, Khabib Nurmagomedov, and contender, Justin Gaethje, I’ve analyzed over 8 thousand UFC fights to gain a greater understanding of the sport of MMA and to determine what factors contribute to a fighter’s success.  The UFC judging system is subjective in nature, which often leaves fans confused about the outcome of fights.  By looking at fight data, we can better recognize fight strategy, the impact of fighter attributes, and the match decision made by the judges.  The UFC fight data sets can be found here and here. In UFC, there are 3 ways in which the winner of a fight can be determined; decision by judges, knock out or technical knockout, or submission.  The below chart shows how often each result type has occurred in the dataset, with about half of all fights going the distance and resulting in decision.  Just about half of all punch attempts are landed, and the chart below shows the rate of punches landed and attempted over the course of the average fight.  UFC fights can either be 3 or 5 rounds with all title fights being 5 rounds (e. g. - Khabib vs Gaethje).  In the third round, fighters attempt more punches on average, but fatigue shows in that they don’t necessarily land more punches than in the previous rounds.  The next plot looks at kicks attempted over the course of the fight.  The winner of the fight on average kicks more in the first few rounds while the loser of the fight starts to kick more than the winner in the later rounds.  Perhaps this is out of desperation of the losing fighter who wants to change their strategy, or perhaps fighters should focus on out kicking their opponent early in the match.  Also, the fighter who goes on to win may generally feel comfortable with his or her lead in the late rounds and be compelled to avoid the higher-risk strike.  Another metric that factors into winning a fight is time in control for each fighter.  The below chart shows the average time in control for the winner and loser of a fight, with the shaded region denoting the 95% internval of time in control. As seen below, the winner of the fight usually spends more time in control. For example, part of Khabib’s fighting strategy is to take his opponent down to the ground and to control him there. It also appears that as the fight goes on and fatigue plays a larger role, there is more neutral time where neither fighter is in control.  The UFC has several weight classes in both the men’s and women’s divisions, and each weight class has its own unique style of fighting.  Generally, heavier weight classes have a slower pace of fighting.  We can see from the below chart that as the weight class increases, there is a downward trend in average significant strikes per fight per fighter.  Additionally, women’s divisions tend to have higher rates of significant strikes when compared to men’s divisions of the same weight.  *** Significant strikes refer to all strikes at distance and power strikes in the clinch and on the ground. Significant strikes can also be broken down by strikes to the head, body, or leg.  The below chart shows the average number of each type of significant strikes by weight class per fight.  Head strikes account for more than half of all significant strikes, and heavier weight classes have a slightly greater proportion of their strikes to the head compared to lighter weight classes.  In addition to breaking down strikes by head, body, and leg, the following chart slices strikes by clinch (up close), distance, and ground.  There is an approximately even distribution of the three types of strikes across the board.  The subsequent chart shows a similar trend around average kicks per fight by weight class.  A statistically notable difference in kicks per fight occurs when comparing women’s divisions to men’s division, with women applying leg kicks about 33% more frequently than men.  The next focus will be on the percent of strikes that are landed by each weight class.  In general, roughly half of all strikes are considered ‘landed’.  As the weight class increases, the rate of landed strikes rises as well.  Lighter weight fighters may have tendencies to attempt strikes even when there’s a low chance of landing them, whereas heavier fighters could be more cautious about only striking when they feel confident in landing.  Because the UFC does not have an objective scoring system in which judges determine the winner of the fight, it’s difficult to say for certain which fighter is winning while watching.  Hence, I’ve created a multivariate regression model in python that predicts the winner of a fight based on their in-fight statistics using data from previous fights.  The below chart takes the results of that model and outputs the most important features that influence the model’s prediction of which fighter won the fight.  Significant strikes to the head and time in control are the two most important features, perhaps due to their nature of clarity and blatancy to judges.  In the case of the dominant women’s Featherweight and Bantamweight belt holder, Amanda Nunes, she typically wins her fights by controlling her opponents and delivering frequent strikes to inflict damage to her opponent.  However, there are other fighters who strategize around controlling their opponents while limiting their strikes and maintaining a defensive approach.  This leads to debate among MMA fans about whether controlling a fight without inflicting much damage to your opponent is worthy of victory.  Finally, I created a second model in python using a Random Forest Classifier algorithm to predict which fighter will win a fight based on their overall statistics entering the fight.  Like the previous model, I outputted the feature importance among the several inputs of the model.  Features prefixed with R denote the fighter in the red corner of the ring (the higher ranked fighter) and features prefixed with B denote the fighter in the blue corner (the lower ranked fighter).  *** “R” prefixed features indicates Red corner fighter and “B” prefixed features indicates Blue corner fighter The most important feature to predict fight outcome is the average significant strikes that a fighter allows their opponent to land on them, followed by the percentage of significant strikes that a fighter allows their opponent to land.  The ‘Defense wins Championships’ expression certainly applies to MMA, as Khabib is rarely hurt by his opponents because of his ability to avoid putting himself in a position for his opponent to land significant strikes.  On the other hand, Gaethje, who comes from a strong wrestling background, tends to fight more offensively by throwing many strikes on his opponents without focusing on controlling them.  The two unique fighting styles should lead to an exciting fight. Some less important features include whether the fighter fights orthodox or southpaw, the weight of the fighter (since opponents are always within proximity of weight with one another), and the number of knock outs.  However, because fighters are of similar weight, it’s not surprising that the height of a fighter plays a somewhat significant role in predicting the fight, as the taller fighter wins just 42% of all fights due to taller fighters likely having less muscle mass than a shorter fighter at the same weight.  Lastly, the above chart indicates that the relative importance of the Red fighter is greater than that of the Blue fighter which implies that the Red fighter’s data is more valuable when predicting the outcome of a fight. While analytics in sports is often associated with team sports like baseball and basketball, individual sports like MMA can also benefit from data driven analyses.  I expect data to eventually shape UFC fight strategy, judging, and spectators’ perception of mixed martial arts as data becomes more prevalent. And finally, using the methodology outlined above, I ran the Random Forest Python model with the statistical inputs from both Khabib and Gaethje, and the results give Khabib a 73% chance to win the fight.

    "title": "2023 NBA Draft Scouting Report",
    "body": "2020/09/10 - The NBA has extremely high expectations for the 2023 draft class, led by French phenom Victor Wembanyama.  However, it’s not just the 7’2” generational prospect that fans and coaches are looking forward to this upcoming season.  The wide range of talent has plenty of teams excited and optimistic about their future.  For the 9 lottery picks that played NCAA men’s basketball, we’ve taken snapshots from our custom advanced analytics scouting report to get a feel for what we might expect out of each player’s rookie season. Note about the data: This data has been captured from ESPN. com for NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball games.  Therefore, we only have scouting reports available for drafted NCAA players.  Also, about 70% of NCAA men’s D1 basketball games have available shot location data on ESPN.  While some data is missing, these heat map charts serve as close representations for each player for the entire season. Notes about the graphs: Heat Map: This shows a player’s shooting percentage from each part of the court, where data is available.  Red refers to above NCAA D1 average and blue is below average.  Effective Field Goal Percentage (eFG%) refers to a weighted field goal percentage that gives 3-point shots a 50% heavier weight than 2-point shots. Full Season Stats: Averages are provided followed by the players percentile within all NCAA D1 men’s basketball. Points Differential Per 40 Minutes: A team’s net point differential standardized per 40 minutes of game time while each player is on or off the court, throughout the season. Team Time to Shoot: This chart breaks the 30 second shot clock into 5 second buckets, showing the percentage of shots that are taken within each bucket, for a sense of the team’s pace of play. Five Minute Buckets: These charts break the 40 minute games into 5 minute consecutive buckets, showing how a player’s trends throughout the game for each respective statistic. Shooting After Offensive Rebounds: Chart on left shows who shoots within 5 seconds after the a team gets an offensive rebound.  Chart on right shows what happens within 5 seconds after the given player gets an offensive rebound. Top 3 Assists by Player: This chart shows who a player gets most assists to and from throughout the season. Scouting Reports: For comments and suggestions, please reach out to danmalter@gmail. com and abmalter12@gmail. com Pick 2: Charlotte Hornets select Brandon Miller, Alabama Brandon Miller shined from both wing 3-point locations this season and sits near the top percentile in just about every statistical category.  Above his great individual stats however, is that Alabama had over a 14 point per 40-minute boost with Miller on the court compared to when he was off the court.  Pick 6: Orlando Magic select Anthony Black, Arkansas Anthony Black doesn’t stand out as a notably great shooter but does it all well.  He is an excellent defender, can get to the rim to score, and is a great passer.  Arkansas was a below average team without him on the court, as he gave his team a near 10-point swing while playing.  As Arkansas’ point guard this season, he also liked to play at a fast pace as about 60% of possessions his team got a shot off in the first 15 seconds of the shot clock.   Pick 8: Indiana Pacers select Jarace Walker, Houston There are two words to describe Jarace Walker: effective and clutch.  He’s a more conservative shooter than other stars around the NCAA, but his effective field goal percentage matches that of Brandon Miller.  He can score from anywhere on the court and is arguably more valuable on defense.  Amazingly, in the last 5 minutes of games, his 2-point shooting percentage sits over 80%, making him one of the best closers in men’s college basketball this season.  Pick 9: Utah Jazz select Taylor Hendricks, UCF Playing for a smaller school, we unfortunately are not able to get as much shooting location data on Hendricks, but what we do know is that he is completely dominant with the ball down low.  He also comes away with a ton of blocks and UCF is a completely different team with him on the court vs off the court.  Pick 10: Oklahoma City Thunder select Carson Wallace, Kentucky Looking at Carson Wallace’s 5-minute bucket stats for both points and steals, you can see he comes out of the gates on fire, both to start the game and to start the second half.  He also turns a gear back up in the final 5 minutes of play but has inconstant trends throughout the rest of the game.  He’s among the top in the nation in both assists and steals, and for a guard does an excellent job scoring in the paint.   Pick 11: Orlando Magic select Jett Howard, Michigan Son of 19-year NBA veteran and Michigan coach Juwan Howard, Jett stands out as an effective scorer, great passer, sharp 3-point shooter, and someone who comes out of the gates hot.  Michigan, however, played better this season with Jett off the court than on.  Pick 12: Dallas Mavericks select Dereck Lively II, Duke While not much of a scorer for Duke this season, big man Dereck Lively was a force down low in the paint on both sides of the ball.  His almost 2 and a half blocks per game were among the top in men’s college basketball this season, and his ability to rebound and give his team second chance points made him a nightmare for opponents.  He works well with point guards, as Duke’s guards Roach and Proctor fed him assists often and he was able to feed Roach back.  Despite his only 5 points per game and lack of shooting anywhere outside of the rim (in his below shot chart we are looking at percent of shot attempts from each zone as opposed to shooting percentage), Duke had an amazing 17-point positive swing per 40 minutes with Lively on the court, making him one of the most valuable men’s college basketball players in the country.   Pick 13: Toronto Raptors select Grady Dick, Kansas Sharpshooter Grady Dick gave NCAA’s toughest conference, the Big 12, a lot of problems this year, with an effective field goal percentage of 55%, his shooting ability around the court makes him incredibly difficult to guard.  He stays consistent throughout the game and gave Kansas a major boost while on the court.   Pick 14: New Orleans Pelicans select Jordan Hawkins, UConn Another great shooter, Jordan Hawkins was consistent and effective with the ball all season long.  He was deadly from 3, can get to the rim, and his shooting helped lead UConn to a national championship.  "

    "title": "Clearing Up COVID-19 Misconceptions",
    "body": "2020/09/01 - Nearly six months after the first COVID-19 outbreak in the United States, there is still some confusion and contradicting claims about the impact of the virus and approaches on containment.  To some extent, lingering questions about the virus need more time and research to be answered, however there are several correctable COVID-19 fallacies that have emerged as a result of either data-less claims or misinterpretations of data.  By analyzing coronavirus data, I’ve attempted to paint a comprehensive picture of COVID-19’s impact including where the virus has been most prevalent, where the virus has been most lethal, and the factors that contribute to increased death rates. The data sources used in the following analyses are linked at the bottom. We’ll begin by looking at the U. S. COVID-19 cases and deaths per week over time.  To date, the United States has confirmed 6 million positive cases resulting in 183 thousand deaths and leaving an estimated overall mortality rate of 3% of confirmed cases.  The below chart indicates the U. S. has experienced two waves of high-volume positive cases. The second wave in the summer resulted in fewer death totals compared to the spring, despite a higher number of cases.  ** We’ll later see that the apparent second wave is not actually a complete second wave, but primarily the first wave in different states. The below chart shows the improvement in reducing the ratio of deaths per case over time. While partially due to increased testing, most countries are now seeing death rates of around 1-2% compared to above 5% for much of the first few months.  ** These are upper-echelon estimates since not everyone infected gets tested, but every COVID-19 death does count as a case. Next, we’ll look at how the United States COVID-19 metrics compare against the countries of Western Europe. Using total counts by country can be misleading and does not account for population sizes. Therefore, the following charts use population adjusted metrics. The chart below shows the United States has far more coronavirus cases, population adjusted, when compared to its Western European counterparts, however does this mean that the U. S. is truly doing the worst? This depends on your definition of success and failure.  When highlighting several non-population adjusted metrics and valuing COVID-19 case count metrics with the same or greater importance as death count metrics, the Washington Post made the claim that the “pandemic has been worse in the U. S. than nearly any other country. ” Conversely, President Trump has made several statements, notably in his interview with Axios that the U. S. has Coronavirus under control and is doing well, citing that our higher number of tests are inflating our number of positive cases relative to other countries.  As it turns out, both claims cherry-pick convenient data to support a predetermined narrative while ignoring or downplaying other countering data, and the reality is that our COVID-19 outlook falls somewhere in between.  There are three distinct ways to define success when it comes to dealing with COVID-19; minimize the timeframe of positive cases, minimize the number of cases, or minimize the number of deaths, and none of which are perfectly correlated as we’ve seen from the above charts.  My assertion is that the correct standard of success should be to minimize the number of deaths.  For example, as seen above, Belgium’s time frame of experiencing high rates of COVID-19 fatalities was relatively short and consistent with neighboring countries, however Belgium also has the highest overall deaths per million (of countries analyzed above).  Portugal, on the other hand, ranks in the top half of Western Europe in cases per million but is near the bottom of deaths per million. Population adjusted, the United States death rate falls in the upper middle range of several of the Western-European countries, despite having by far the most confirmed cases.  However, the slope for the U. S. is still increasing at a higher rate than other countries, suggesting that the U. S. is further from the coronavirus finish line than Western Europe. Because the above charts only compare the U. S. to Western Europe, the next two charts use the same measures but compare the U. S. to other noteworthy COVID-19 impacted nations around the world.  To better understand how to minimize the number of COVID-19 deaths, it’s important to note that the 183 thousand deaths in the United States are not of equal proportions within age demographics and when considering pre-existing health conditions.  About 1,500 (&lt; 1%) deaths resulted from COVID-19 are of people under the age of 35, a few hundred of which are under the age of 25.  Meanwhile, about 59% of COVID-19 deaths are from ages 75 and over and more than 80% of deaths are from ages 65 and over.  **The CDC Age Group data set accounts for 153 thousand USA deaths out of the 183 thousand total USA deaths When analyzing how comorbidities play into COVID-19 deaths, the CDC reported that “for 6% of the deaths, Covid-19 was the only cause mentioned. For deaths with conditions or causes in addition to Covid-19, on average, there were 2. 6 additional conditions or causes per death. ” The below charts show the number of deaths tied to each of several common comorbidities in the United States, first by all Americans, and then broken down by each age group.  Perhaps the most threatening comorbidity is diabetes, as 10% of Americans have diabetes but about 27% of COVID-19 deaths were of diabetics.  Furthermore, each comorbidity affects each age group at a different rate.     With 94% of COVID-19 deaths involving at least one comorbidity and &lt; 1% of deaths being under the age of 35, the estimated number of American mortalities under age 35 with no comorbidities is approximately 110 people. This is not to downplay the seriousness of the virus responsible for the loss of 840 thousand lives around the world, but to provide insight to the attributes that increase or decrease an individual’s level of risk. Next, we’ll break down COVID-19 statistics state by state within the United States.  The below plot shows total cases per week among several of the hardest hit states.  As mentioned previously, using total cases and ignoring deaths can be deceiving and distort comparability.  Below is an unadjusted plot similar to those used in some reports that have overexaggerated the virus’s impact in Florida.  A more representative graph to depict Florida’s comparability to other states is the total deaths per million.  The below graph shows each state’s deaths per million as opposed to above which strictly represents number of positive cases.  As seen above, Florida surpassed New York in total cases, but as seen below, Florida’s deaths per million is about one-quarter of that of New York and New Jersey.  California and Texas are in similar company to Florida while Massachusetts is comparable to its Northeast neighbors.  Despite New York’s significant number of deaths shown above, the New York Times reported that New York ‘beat the virus’.  In doing so, the standard of success has shifted from minimizing deaths to minimizing the timeframe.  By looking below at new deaths per week (both absolute and population adjusted) for each of these states, the importance of ‘flattening the curve’ becomes apparent.  New York did not flatten their curve resulting in the highest spike of deaths, albeit a shorter window of high death rates.  With Florida, Texas, California, and New York all showing comparable waves of COVID-19 cases, there are a few possible theories as to why New York has almost as many deaths as the other 3 states combined.  One theory is that New York City is the most densely populated major city in America.  However, the below chart shows that population density has no correlation to the percentage of a population that will be infected.  Each point in the graph represents a county in the U. S. between the population density between 1000 people per square mile and 10,000 (to remove outliers).  San Francisco, the city with the 2nd highest population density after New York City, has a low number of cases and deaths compared to other major American cities.  The Citizens Housing Planning Council of New York City has reported that even within New York City, population density of each borough has no correlation to cases, suggesting that attributing high volume of COVID-19 cases to population density is innacurate.  While it’s more difficult to show with data, other theories surrounding the likely cause of New York’s steep outbreak include a high number of introductions to the virus and virus containment strategy.  To assess the relationship that the virus has among cities within a state, the final charts below show a breakdown of a few selective states that have had high quantity of cases and have highly populated cities within their state. Notably, in Ohio, there was little correlation between the timeframe of deaths when comparing the major cities, as many cities experienced their highest death rates at different times.  On the other hand, in Texas and Florida there appears to be more correlation of the death rates from city to city over time and in California, Los Angeles has maintained significantly higher death rates than other cities within the state for the majority of the past 6 months.   Each city, state, country, and continent has been impacted by and dealt with COVID-19 in different ways.  The data that’s been collected is an extremely powerful tool to use when drawing conclusions related to COVID-19 and when making decisions on how to best mitigate the virus moving forward. Misinterpreting data or excluding pivotal information can lead to flawed conclusions or counterproductive decision making.  To make the best use of data, it’s important to absorb all available information and to settle on a consistent standard of success. Thanks for reading!

    "title": "Are 60 Games Enough for MLB Trends to 'Regress to the Mean'?",
    "body": "2020/07/23 - Every year after MLB’s first month, there seems to be one or two players who are on pace to break Barry Bonds’ homerun record, or a team that is on pace to have the best record of all time.  Of course, we all know that these are unlikely outcomes because of the statistics phenomenon of ‘Regression Towards the Mean’.  The law of Regression Towards the Mean asserts that as a sample size gets larger (number of games), variables (player and team statistics) will move closer towards their true average. This MLB season, which will comprise of just 60 games (seasons are typically 162 games) will be especially exciting because we’re not sure if 60 games is a large enough sample size for all statistics to regress towards the mean.  Hence, we may see a much greater variation of team records and individual player statistics than we normally observe in a full season.  In this article, we’ll analyze the regression of 2019 player and team stats to better predict what we might see in the 2020 season, followed by the results of my 2020 division win probability model. Batting Average and Home Runs are a baseball fan’s two favorite stats to track at the individual player level.  The below charts take the 2019 season leaders for each respective category and plot their cumulative stats over the course of the season.  Against the player’s regressing lines are the all-time leaders for those categories.  (Rogers Hornsby is the all time Batting Average leader of the last 100 years).  Tim Anderson of the White Sox, who finished the season with the best batting average, jumped off to an incredible start, but only maintained a higher average than Hornsby for about 3 weeks, and by 60 games was well under.  It took around 40 games for each of these players to reach within a very close margin of their final season batting average.  Christian Yelich of the Brewers and Cody Bellinger of the Dodgers were able to maintain pace above Barry Bonds’ all-time home run record for about 40 games as well, but soon dropped below and never again came close. Pete Alonso of the Mets, who finished the season as the leader, was always far below Bonds’ pace and did not jump to the top until the final month of the season.  At the team level, statistics will converge to their true average far before the individuals due to the team having a greater sample size.  The below charts look at On Base Percentage (OBP) for each team, showing that it took just about 30 games for teams to be within close range of their final season On Base Percentage.  From the above charts, it might be a reasonable inference that team standings were also mostly solidified after around 30 to 40 games, however that was not the case.  The following 6 charts show the cumulative team wins over the course of the 2019 season.  The Braves and Cardinals, who eventually went on to win their divisions, would have come up short in a 60 game season.  Even among the teams that finished both the 60 and 162 game markers in first place, there were swaps in the standings along the way.    Last year on MLB Opening Day, I posted playoff probability predictions and the method I used to obtain those predictions.  This year, I’ve used the same method, but I adjusted the standard deviations for a 60-game season, to get the 2020 playoff probabilities.  In the charts below, I’ve also included what each team’s chances would have been if there was a full season.  The glaring takeaway is that a 60-game season is very beneficial to underdogs.  In the American League, the Red Sox, Athletics, and Angels probabilities have been tripled, doubled, and tripled respectively.  In the National League, we see similar improvements for the Phillies, Padres, and Diamondbacks.  On the contrary, teams that would have incredibly high playoff chances in a full season such as the Yankees, Astros, and Dodgers, now are no better than a coin flip.  "

    "title": "Analysis of the Allies' WWII Strategy",
    "body": "2020/04/13 - Next month, May 8th, will mark the 75th anniversary of Victory in Europe (VE) Day, when Winston Churchill announced Nazi Germany’s unconditional surrender from World War II, officially bringing an end to the Holocaust and to the war in Europe.  Defeating Fascism required a well-planned, well-executed war strategy along with the sacrifices of millions of people who contributed to the Allies’ efforts.  To better understand their strategy, I’ve created a visual analysis from over 175 thousand records of documented Allied aerial missions by the United States, Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand, across all theaters of operation from the 6-year war.  The map above is outlined by modern-day Europe with pre-World War II labels.  Each point represents the target location of a unique aerial mission, whether it be by bomber, fighter, glider, or other type of aircraft.  The data comes from the Theater History of Operations Reports and consists mostly of the United States Air Force and the Royal Air Force of Great Britain with minimal records from the Royal Australian Air Force and the Royal New Zealand Air Force, however data is missing from both nations’ campaigns in Europe.  Additionally, there was no data provided for several other key Allied powers such as Canada, the Soviet Union, and Poland.  Also, given that the data was collected from 1939-1945, there are surely cases of inaccuracies and missing records, notably data from Great Britain (Battle of Britain), Australia, and New Zealand. Among the astounding number of European, North African, and Mediterranean countries impacted by battle, the locations of highly concentrated aerial action can be associated with territories of strongest Nazi control.  Vichy (Southern) France along with neutral Switzerland, Spain, and Portugal were the only countries in Western Europe that avoided complete bombardment.  Had USSR data been available, Poland and many other Eastern European nations would more closely resemble the destruction seen in Western Europe.  In the Pacific Theater, we can similarly see that the devastation of war was unavoidable across the map as Japan’s Emperor Hirohito sought to expand Japanese influence across the resource rich Pacific Islands; many of which were colonized by Western Powers.  The Imperial Japanese Empire capitalized on the vulnerability of Nazi-occupied France and Netherlands, and the tied-up British, by invading their respective colonies and ruthlessly killing civilians and prisoners of war that stood in their way.  The Philippines (at the time an American territory) and Pearl Harbor were key military targets for Japan, who took a gamble that a crippled U. S. Navy would buy the Japanese enough time to pursue expansion without a full-strength opposition.  The U. S. suffered overwhelming losses in the surprise invasions of both islands with the attack of the Philippines occurring just 10 hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor. (1) The Japanese proceeded to imprison and murder thousands of American and Filipino soldiers, however three years later the island was ultimately freed after American General Douglas MacArthur commanded the victorious Battle of Leyte, leading to eventual Philippines independence. (2)  It took 6 years for the Allies to declare victory in WWII from the moment the war began with the Nazi’s Blitzkrieg (Lightning War) invasion of Poland.  The first major turning point in favor of the Allies in Europe (where the graph begins to slope upwards) wasn’t until 1943 when the Soviet Union’s Red Army prevailed in what became the deadliest battle in war history, the battle of Stalingrad. (3) Following the Red Army’s victory in defending their iconic city, named after their dictator, they launched a counter offensive to the west with newfound confidence. (4) Meanwhile, the other Allied Powers were advancing up the boot of Italy and preparing for a large-scale invasion of France.  A year later the Americans, British, and Canadians did just that when they stormed the beaches of Normandy on D-Day, completely changing the tide of war, and combat in Europe spiked for 11 months as the Allies pushed the Nazis towards their inevitable surrender.  The map below the timeline represents the locations of Allied aerial attacks over the course of the war, implying the path the Allies took (light to dark) through France and Southern Italy as they closed in on the heart of Nazi territory. Having seen where and when the aerial missions took place, we’ll next look at which types of aircrafts were leading these missions.  Among the U. S. Air Force, the B-24 Liberator Bomber was the most used aircraft throughout the war.  The bomber generally carried 8-10 men, including two pilots, several gunners, and an imperative, highly skilled bombardier responsible for hitting the precise target while accounting for aircraft speed, altitude, wind speed, air density, weather conditions, and bomb ballistics. (5) At roughly 200 mph and up to 25,000 feet in the air, often only the lead aircraft in a group required a bombardier while the others would follow suit. (6) The second most common type of aircraft was the fighter jet, and among those the A-20 Havoc led the most missions.  A much smaller, faster, and more agile plane than the bomber, the fighter jets were used for aerial combat, often shooting down the enemy and protecting their own bombers. (7)  For the Americans and their Allies, the war could not have been won without the continuous improvement of science and technology.  In the case of aerial bombing, the force of explosive bombs that were being rained on Europe and the Pacific was rapidly increasing until the war began to die down late in 1944.  By the peak of the war, a typical bomb had a force akin to 20 tons of TNT, more than 5 times the force of what was being dropped by US bombers at the beginning of the war.  By comparison, the atomic bombs, named Little Boy and Fat Man, that USA dropped over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki respectively, had TNT equivalents of 15 thousand and 20 thousand tons.  There were four main categories of explosives used by the Americans, most commonly a General Purpose Bomb.  The chart below is a sample of several hundred bombs that the U. S. Air Force dropped, mapping the bombs to the type of target that they hit.  We can further understand the Allies’ brilliant chess-like strategy by plotting the mission targets on a map.  For example, the Nazi’s placed several gun emplacements along the most heavily fortified section of the western coast of Europe in Northern France.  Once the Allies broke through Hitler’s coastal fortress on D-Day, June 6, 1944, they heavily bombed highways, bridges and river crossings to make it difficult for the Nazis to send additional support.  Moreover, much of the genius of General Eisenhower’s D-Day Operation Overlord came from the deception that the Allies played on Hitler and the Nazis, who were sure that the Allies intended to break into Northwest Europe through Pas de Calais, the point in Northern France nearest to Great Britain.  Toying with the Nazi’s imagination, the Allies stationed an army under high profile American General George Patton on the British side of the English Channel and sent recurrent decoy missions to Calais before and after June 6th.  False intelligence sent to Nazi high command ‘confirmed’ their phantom beliefs, and by the time the Nazis fully understood that the bloody Normandy landings were not a diversion, hundreds of thousands of Allied soldiers had landed in France and were well on their way to liberating Paris. (8) In the south of Europe, Italy endured as severe an aerial assault as any other country, especially in their northern territory which was under Nazi occupation after the Italians surrendered to the Allies and arrested their Fascist dictator, Benito Mussolini. (9) With the help of the Italian partisans waging a guerilla resistance, a key objective for the Allies was to dismantle Nazi transportation since they relied on railroads, highways, and bridges to ship food and supplies stolen from the Italians back to their homeland.  Most of these goods were shipped by railway through the German-annexed Austrian territory, accounting for the plethora of green there on the map above. As this analysis goes to show, many key events in World War II can be better understood by supplementing the accounts of surviviors and historians with data.  Although this data has flaws and is specific to aerial missions, it’s a reflection of the combat that unfolded from all branches of all armed forces that fought in the war.  If you’re as interested in World War II as I am and would like to learn more, I’ve included below several related articles, books, and movies that I found enjoyable.

    "title": "Analyzing NHL Gameplay Data",
    "body": "2020/03/02 - This analysis will explore how to use and analyze NHL gameplay data.  All data is provided from statsapi. web. nhl. com/ for the 2019-20 NHL season through the date of this posting. All code is provided on my personal GitHub site. The below images show shot charts for both Patrick Kane and Nikita Kucherov.  Goals are represented by the dots and shots are represented as an ‘x’.  You can play around with these charts through an interactive application here. Given that Kane is a right wing, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that most of his shots are from right of the goal, but charts like this can start to show deeper information by answering questions about Kane’s success rate from the right and left sides of the goal. Although this plot can be informative to players and how they might strategize, it doesn’t show how many shots ricocheted off of the goalie and resulted in a team goal.  With that being said, we can still find interesting patterns from analyzing this data.  For example, Kane shoots and scores from both sides of the net, but when comparing him to another top scoring right wing, Nikita Kucherov, we see that Kucherov shoots the vast majority of his shots from the right side only.  Teams can start to use this information in planning for how to defend against certain players.  You can play around with the shot charts here for any player in the NHL.  This interactive application provides a lot more information for each shot and provides the ability to filter data based on things such as the period, team against, shot type, etc.  We can also use network graphs to show who is involved the most when a given player scores.  In this case, we’re looking at a network graph for Patrick Kane’s goals.  The size of the bubble represents the player’s involvement in Kane’s goals and the arrows represents a pass from one player to another based on direction of the arrow. For all of Kane’s goals, Jonathan Toews has the most involvement.  It’s important to note that in hockey two players can have an assist, so we can see connections from multiple players leading to Kane.  For example, one specific goal occurred from Brandon Saad (top left) to Jonathan Toews to Patrick Kane.  Another one of Kane’s goals was by a pass from Jonathan Toews to Dominik Kubalik to Patrick Kane for a goal.  Finally, we have a heat map for every single shot taken to date in the 2019-20 NHL season.  The bright yellow area shows the highest density of where shots occur from, which to no surprise is right in front of the net.  However, it’s interesting to see that as players take shots further from the net, it’s either directly in front of the net or at about a 45-degree angle.  "

    "title": "The Legendary Career of Kobe Bryant Visualized in Data",
    "body": "2020/01/28 - With the tragic loss of Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna, we reflect on his dominant career with the Lakers by showcasing his remarkable 20 seasons in the NBA.  Using the ggplot2 library in R and leveraging data from Kaggle’s Kobe Bryant Shot Selection competition, we’ve created several data visualizations that display his achievements.  All code and data can be found here. Below is a shot chart containing all 30,699 shots that he took from 1996-2016, separating his makes from his misses.  There’s essentially nowhere on the court that Kobe couldn’t score from, but he especially excelled with his mid-range jumpers from the shoulders and baseline.  Further below you’ll see similar shot charts broken down by type of made shot and average accuracy among different regions on the court.  When looking at the frequency of the Mamba’s shooting over the course of the game, it’s apparent that the superstar wants the ball as the clock approaches zero.  The four tall spikes represent the final minute of each quarter.  Kobe often got his rest in the first 4-6 minutes of the 2nd and 4th quarters, accounting for the dips on those regions of the chart.  Among his game-ending shots taken, the 2nd chart on this page shows which teams suffered the most final second daggers from Kobe.  Amazingly, every team from his era fell victim at least twice (Vancouver became Memphis in 2001).  Next, we’re looking at the trend of Bryant’s shot accuracy over the course of his career.  Early in his career, he struggled to maintain the same success in the playoffs that he had in the regular season, but that eventually changed as he made his way to his 5 championships.  The most impressive part of these charts, however, is that 17 seasons into his career he was shooting as well as he ever had been.  The below two charts compliment what we’ve seen so far but are broken down by opponent and shot type.  Most of his better numbers came from Western conference teams, perhaps due to less travel, but also likely due to his competitive nature of wanting to dominate his rivals.  However, among all the Eastern conference teams, Kobe always played his best in the spotlight against New York.  When it comes to shot type, his smooth touch resulted in a successful bank shot more than three quarters of the time! The below chart shows the impressive constant shot improvement from Kobe over the course of the season.  Like most NBA players, he does show a slight decline late in the season as the fatigue from his ‘always give 100%’ mentality eventually kicks in.  He also consistently was near the top of the league in games and minutes played.  However, when the playoffs enter the picture, Kobe has historically put his fatigue aside and outperformed his regular-season-self.  The June decline can likely be attributed to only playing the league’s best defenders in the NBA finals.  When looking at his success distributed over the course of the game, the results are similar in a few ways.  Kobe remains consistent and does show a predictable slight dip in the 4th quarter but is able to rejuvenate himself for overtime.  Finally, Kobe Bryant is perhaps best known for always being the hardest worker on the court.  Despite his shooting numbers declining late in his career, his effort on the court remained elite.  In a 2015 game against the Wizards, a 37-year-old-Kobe was keeping up with young stars by moving 2. 73 miles in his 36 minutes of time on the court.  With or without the ball, Kobe’s constant movement made him nearly impossible to guard, even in his final season.  "

    "title": "The Statistical Value of Going For It On 4<sup>th</sup> Down",
    "body": "2019/09/09 - With the 2019 NFL season under way, we’re reminded of the timeless debate about whether teams should go for it on 4th down, depending on the game situation.  While coaches, players, and fans may all have different opinions on the matter, I’ve analyzed over 100 thousand snaps from the 2016-2018 NFL regular seasons to form statistical decisions that will maximize the probability of winning the game.  The below chart summarizes my results, followed by an in-depth breakdown of the steps I took in Python to transform raw play-by-play data into usable results.  This chart should be interpreted as a general baseline for NFL teams as it does not account for game factors such as score, time left in the game, team ability, weather, etc.  The primary goal of my analysis was to create a decision chart that displays the statistically optimal 4th down choice a team should make depending on field position and yards to go.  With an ever-changing NFL (higher scoring games, new rules, etc. ) I decided that 3 seasons of data (2016-2018) would give me enough plays to have valid results while also not derailing my analysis with old data that might not apply in today’s game.  In order to achieve my output, I broke the analysis into 4 sections and aggregated the results as my final step.  The 4 areas of analysis are:  Expected Points on a Drive (Depending on starting field position) 4th Down Conversion Rates (Different for goal to go Vs. regular) Expected Net Punt Distance (Depending on returns and touchbacks) Field Goal Percentage (Depending on distance)For each of these areas, I used Python in a Jupyter Notebook as my statistical analysis tool.  I’ve detailed the results and interpretations in the below sections, while my Python code as well as the steps I took to transform raw play-by-play data into a usable aggregated data set can be found on my Github page. Expected Points on a Drive The expected points on a drive metric was the foundation of the analysis, providing us the value of starting field position.  The expected point values can be interpreted as the league average of how many points get scored among all drives that began with the same field position.  For example, if there were 100 drives that began between the offensive team’s 20-24-yard line for a total of 200 points scored (including defensive touchdowns as negative points), then the expected points for those drives is 2.  Additionally, I removed drives from my data set that began with under 3 minutes left in the 1st half and under 5 minutes left in the game since those drives often have alternative intentions to scoring a touchdown (e. g. - running the clock out, kicking a half-ending field goal).  Unsurprisingly, the expected point value trends upwards as the starting field position gets better, however also note that the variation of expected points slightly grows as field position gets better.  The table below provides further metrics on a basis of field position that bring additional value to the analysis.  I found it interesting that the average plays per drive are relatively steady just until you get close to the opposing team’s end zone.  Other notable takeaways are that the percent chance of a touchdown has an unsurprising upward trend with field position and drives starting between the opponents 21-25 have the highest chance of ending in a field goal.  4th Down Success Rates The next essential metric to make the 4th down decision is the average success rates based on how many yards are to go for a first down.  As the distance to the first down gets greater, there are fewer attempts to look at, however enough to generally confirm that the success rates drop as distance grows.  Intuitively, 4th and 10 has far more attempts than it’s neighboring distances due to the high quantity of drives that have 3 consecutive incomplete passes.  4th down plays with greater than 10 yards to go has an insignificant number of attempts so I chose to remove those from the equation.  Separately, I calculated the 4th down conversion rates for 4th and goal-to-go plays.  For plays of greater than 1 yard to the endzone, there are very few attempts for conclusive evidence, however we can still get a reasonable understanding of what happens in these situations.  Since these plays deal with a 12th defender (the back of the end zone) and are generally higher-pressure situations, it’s predictable that the 4th down conversion rate in goal-to-go situations is lower than it is for other parts of the field.  Net Punt Distances Another consideration to make when deciding whether to go for it is the expected yard line that the opposing team will begin their next drive.  This includes the possibility of a return, a touchback, penalties, or a block.  The chart and table below display the average net distances of punts, and that there’s a noticeable downward trend in net distance as punting team’s field position gets closer to the opposing team’s end zone.  Punts on the opposing side of the field generally have a very low net distance, and we will later see how they provide very little field position value.  Field Goal Percentages When within range, the 4th down conversation changes from ‘should we punt?’ to ‘should we kick the field goal?’ This requires us to take into consideration field goal averages when making this decision, and the below chart and table lay these out for us.  The surprising result here is that 41% of field goals in the opponents 41-45-yard line range are successful.  Likely the reason for this is that only elite kickers are given the opportunity to kick from that range and it would be much lower more teams attempted field goals from this distance.  Putting it all together The final step of the analysis is to compile all the above information to make our decisions in each situation, as displayed on the chart on the front page.  This step of the process has a heavy math focus and the below example will demonstrate how probability theory can be used to obtain the final conclusions.  As mentioned in the introduction, these conclusions are generic and would need to be adjusted depending on the game situation.  For example, teams with great defenses may be more inclined to punt with their ability to force a 3-and-out in order to get good field position back on their next possession.  In other cases, you may just need a field goal based on the game situation or have a great quarter back and play drawn up that will give you a better chance to convert than the league average.  Additionally, the weather and ability of your offensive line, kicker, or punter could play large factors that are not accounted for in this calculation. Example: 4th and 3 on your own 42-yard line. We will first record the important metrics for the calculation.  4th down conversion rate with 3 yards to go: 45% Expected points scored if converted (assuming 1st down will be in own 45 - 49 yard-line range: 3. 15 points Expected points for opposing team if they start on their opponents 41-45-yard line: (incase the conversion fails) 3. 29 points Expected Net Punt Distance (from 42-yard line): 40. 43 yards Expected points for opposing team if punted (assuming start at 18-yard line with expected punt distance: 1. 65 pointsNext, we will walk through the possible decisions and their consequential outcomes:  Go for it and convert: 45% of conversion success for 3. 15 expected points if converted gives this outcome a value of 1. 42 points Go for it and fail: 55% chance of fail for 3. 29 expected points gives this outcome a value of 1. 81 points for the opposing team Punt: The opposing team’s expected points is 1. 65; your team expected points is 0 (drive over)Here is what the expected point outcomes look like in a contingency table: The decision to go for it gives your team a net difference in expected points of -0. 39, while the decision to punt is -1. 65.  Therefor, simply by making the decision to punt, you are conceding an additional 1. 26 net expected points.  For punting to be the smarter decision, the net difference in going for it would have to be a larger negative than the net difference in punting. Using the same logic, I went through all the combinations of game situations to make a unique conclusion that maximizes the offensive team’s expected outcome.  If I found the difference in expected points for each decision was within a small deviation of each other or if I did not have enough observations to be convinced in the result, then I disregarded a definitive choice and labelled that situation ‘neutral’.  For all others, I’ve confidently recorded my results and hope that NFL teams will adopt this data driven approach to 4th down decision making! "

    "title": "Using Calculus to Derive MLB Division Probabilities",
    "body": "2019/03/28 - Happy MLB Opening Day! You may be wondering what your team’s chances are of making the playoffs, but you’re not sure which website’s model to trust.  I’ve created my own set of predictions using calculus and probability theory to derive the chance for each team to win their respective division.  For the math crowd, I’ve detailed my process and formulas below the results.  The steps I used to reach my conclusions are summarized below:  Averaged out the predicted 2019 win totals from several analytics websites and Vegas books Analyzed 9 previous seasons worth of win total predictions to understand the trends of means and variance of the residuals (How far off predictions were from actual win totals) Based on above steps, for each team I built a unique probability density function (PDF) for the expected wins for 2019 Used calculus in Python to derive the probability that each team wins more games than the other 4 teams in their divisionStep 1: Average out the 2019 predicted win totals from several analytics websites and Vegas books Many analytics websites have published the results from their respective models to predict the 2019 season outcome.  While most models have similar results, it’s difficult to tell what went into each model and which models are likely to be the most accurate.  Rather than picking just one or trying to develop my own model, I leveraged and averaged the results from several models as well as Vegas over/under totals as a starting point for my analysis.  The averages are what is displayed in the above tables. Step 2: Analyze previous seasons of win total predictions to understand the trends of means and variance of the residuals (How far off predictions were from actual win totals) If I’m going to use these predictions in my analysis, I first need to understand historically how well these same types of models perform.  Thankfully, Fangraphs, one of the website models I leveraged, has already published the results of a 9 year win total prediction analysis compared to actual outcomes.  Relevant to what I’m trying to accomplish, here are a couple key takeaways:  Teams with low win total predictions have a better chance of overperforming their prediction than teams with high win total predictions.  The function for predicted wins vs. actual wins can be written as y = 0. 81x + 14. 97 The variance of residuals for low win total predictions is wider than the variance for high win total predictions (teams with high win total predictions are more likely to have actual win totals closer to the predicted win totals) The residuals appear to be normally distributedTo address the change in residual variance, I downloaded the prediction and actual win total data and calculated the standard deviation of the residuals for high win total predictions, medium win total predictions, and low win total predictions. s_High = 6. 262369 s_Med = 6. 41859 s_Low = 7. 30217 Step 3: Build a unique probability density function (PDF) for the expected wins for each team in 2019 In probability theory, a probability density function (PDF) is a distribution that describes the probability of events occurring from a continuous random variable.  By only knowing the mean and standard deviation, we can derive each PDF with calculus.  We’ll use the Yankees as an example to demonstrate how this plays out: The Yankees are projected to win 97 games with a standard deviation of 6. 26 games.  We’ve previously concluded that the prediction distribution for their win total is very close to normally distributed, so we can draw the distribution in the bell curved fashion: where: The important takeaway from the above curve is that the values on the x axis are more likely under tall points in the curve and less likely under short parts of the curve.  A nice feature of PDF’s is that by using standard probability theorems we can easily calculate the probability of the Yankees winning at least X games in 2019 or derive a prediction interval for the range of win totals that they are likely to finish between. Step 4: Use calculus in Python to derive the probability that each team wins more games than the other 4 teams in their division To predict the probability that each team wins their division, we need to calculate the probability that they finish with a better record than all the other teams in their division. (Disclaimer: I did not consider the possibility of ties and winning the division in game 163) The formula can be expressed as: P(A wins) = P(A&gt;B) * P(A&gt;C) * P(A&gt;D) * P(A&gt;E) where the 5 divisional teams are A, B, C, D and E Thus, the challenge is to derive P(A&gt;B), and the rest will follow suit. To visualize this, let’s go back into context and use the Yankees and Rays as an example. Mu_Yankees = 97, s_Yankees = 6. 262369 Mu_Rays = 85, s_Rays = 6. 41859 Their overlapping PDF’s would look like the graph below with the Rays in green and the Yankees in blue.  The probability that the Yankees finish with a greater win total than the Rays is equivalent to the probability that a random point chosen under the blue curve is greater than a random point chosen under the green curve.  In order to do so, we will derive the below formula: It’s technically improper that we assumed that the distributions are independent of each other.  Afterall, the Yankees and Rays play each other 18 times per season.  However, to account for the dependence of those games would only complicate the equation and likely not change our results much. Now that we understand how to derive P(A&gt;B), the final step was to write some Python code to make all these calculations for me and output the results.  Below is a sample of my code for the AL East.  "

    "title": "Using K-Means Clustering to Optimize NBA Lineups",
    "body": "2019/02/27 - As the NBA trade deadline has recently passed, basketball fans from around the world have expressed mixed reactions to many of the moves (or moves that never were) made around the league. With the prevalence of analytics in professional sports, it’s reasonable to wonder whether decisions are mostly shaped as a result of data analysis or intuition. As outsiders, we’ll never truly know the specific indicators that lead to each decision, however my curiosity urged me to perform an analysis of my own to innovate the way that teams are comprised. You don’t need analytics to convince yourself that if you want to win a championship in the NBA, your team needs an elite star.  Where analytics can help, however, is to optimally assemble your roster around the one or two stars that your team pursues.  We can use data to drive roster and lineup decisions based on the hypothesis that certain styles of play compliment each other better than others.  In search for answers, I sifted through tens of thousands of 2016-17 and 2017-18 NBA in-game possessions to understand the on-court combination of player types that have the most success together. As a prerequisite to the analysis, I defined and differentiated 7 unique player types by running a K-Means Clustering model on a set of advanced NBA statistics, in R.  Inspired by Muthu Alagappan’s From 5 to 13, Redefining the Positions in Basketball, the purpose for creating clusters (as opposed to using the 5 commonly known basketball positions) was to specifically group players together who share a similar style of play regardless of their ambiguously labelled position.  Below is a description of each of the 7 defined clusters as outputs of the algorithm, along with the traits and notable players that make up each cluster. Cluster 1: Game-Managing Guards Common traits: High percentage of team’s assists, slower pace of play than combo guards, lower percentage of points outside of paint Notable players: Chris Paul, Russel Westbrook, Rajon Rondo, Kyle Lowry, Lonzo Ball, Ricky Rubio Cluster 2: Combo Guards Common traits: Scoring-minded guards, looks to score with shooting and driving, faster pace of play than game-managing guards Notable players: Steph Curry, James Harden, Kemba Walker, Kyrie Irving Cluster 3: Work-off-the-ball, Shooters Common traits: Most shots are taken outside, high percentage of points are assisted, do not spend a lot of time with the ball in hand Notable players: Klay Thompson, Kyle Korver, Doug McDermott Cluster 4: Versatile Forwards Common traits: Takes many shots, look to consistently score with shooting and driving, look to create their own shots rather than catch and shoot Notable players: Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Jimmy Butler, Giannis Antetokounmpo Cluster 5: Shooting Bigs Common traits: Bigs who take many outside shots, offensive minded bigs Notable players: Dirk Nowitzki, Kristaps Portzingis, Niko Mirotic Cluster 6: Live-in-the-Post, Bigs Common traits: Score most of their points in the paint, do not frequently take jumps shots, can be offensive and defensive minded Notable players: Anthony Davis, Dwight Howard, LaMarcus Aldridge Cluster7: Defensive-Focused Bigs Common traits: Mostly are in the game for their defense, take relatively few shots Notable players: Hassan Whiteside, Tristan Thompson, Zach Randolph Now that we have clearly defined clusters, the next step I have taken is to analyze the success metrics of combinations of clusters while they are playing together.  The NBA collects lineup data from 2-player lineups to 5-player lineups, which provides the complete stats that are taken while the specific combination of players are on the court at the same time.  The below chart reflects data from the previous two completed seasons and can be interpreted as each value representing the average NETRTG when a player from the labelled cluster is on the court at the same time as a player from the titled cluster, regardless of the other 3 players.  While not shown below, it’s also possible to break down ratings specifically by offense and defense. NETRTG: Measures a team’s point differential per 100 possessions while the player is in the game  It’s interesting to see how NETRTG values change from cluster to cluster, however we must be aware of possible confounding variables; For example, if two versatile forwards are on the court together, it’s less likely that any of the other 3 players are also versatile forwards.  Nonetheless, we recognize that pure shooting forwards have more success with combo guards than with game-managing guards, and versatile forwards have more success with game-managing guards than with combo guards, whatever the reasons may be. It was compelling to zoom into single clusters to see how they pair with others, however the heat map below provides us a holistic view of cluster combo success.  The axis numbers correspond to the clusters defined above and the data values represent the mean NETRTG for each combination of cluster.  There’s a consensus in the basketball community that teams need to an elite star to consider themselves relevant.  The above heatmap should serve as a guide to team front offices who are making crucial decisions about who else to sign, trade for, and put on the court.  We can also run the same analysis on 3, 4, and 5-player cluster combos, although it would be difficult to visualize those dimensions of data.  My advice doesn’t change the fact that teams should always go for the best available player within their price range, however this cluster analysis should certainly be used in cases of uncertainty. "
