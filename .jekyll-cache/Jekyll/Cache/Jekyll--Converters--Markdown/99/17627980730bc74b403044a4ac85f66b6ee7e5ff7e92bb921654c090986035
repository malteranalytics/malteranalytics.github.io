I"<p>Year after year, March Madness continues to prove that data science cannot crack every code.   There’s far too much variance among the estimated 120 Billion possible ways to reasonably fill out a bracket.  Just as an AI algorithm can’t predict the result of a coin toss any better than a human being can, algorithms can only do so much when predicting a single elimination basketball tournament of 68 college teams that spread across dozens of leagues.  While analyzing tournament data won’t give you a perfect bracket, it can however slightly increase your chances of winning your bracket pool.  I’ve always believed the fun in March Madness is picking a bracket with your heart, but for the games you can’t make up your mind, maybe some data insights can sway your decision.</p>
