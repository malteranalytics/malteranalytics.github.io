I"*<p>With the 2019 NFL season under way, we’re reminded of the timeless debate about whether teams should go for it on 4th down, depending on the game situation.  While coaches, players, and fans may all have different opinions on the matter, I’ve analyzed over 100 thousand snaps from the <a href="http://nflsavant.com/about.php" target="_blank">2016-2018 NFL regular seasons</a> to form statistical decisions that will maximize the probability of winning the game.  The below chart summarizes my results, followed by an in-depth breakdown of the steps I took in Python to transform raw play-by-play data into usable results.   This chart should be interpreted as a general baseline for NFL teams as it does not account for game factors such as score, time left in the game, team ability, weather, etc.</p>
