I"/<p>As the NBA trade deadline has recently passed, basketball fans from around the world have expressed mixed reactions to many of the moves (or moves that never were) made around the league. With the prevalence of analytics in professional sports, it’s reasonable to wonder whether decisions are mostly shaped as a result of data analysis or intuition. As outsiders, we’ll never truly know the specific indicators that lead to each decision, however my curiosity urged me to perform an analysis of my own to innovate the way that teams are comprised.</p>
