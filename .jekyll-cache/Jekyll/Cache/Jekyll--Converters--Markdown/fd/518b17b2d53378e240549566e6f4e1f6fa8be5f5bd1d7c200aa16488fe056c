I"ò<p>The 2021 Masters is underway this week and despite all the unpredictability of the tournament, golfer trends from the past several years will show which traits are most often correlated with success.  The below table shows the correlation that several variables have with a playerâ€™s performance during Masterâ€™s Weekend.  The data that feeds into this table goes back to 2015 to find golferâ€™s statistics between the start of each season and the tournament leading up to the Masters, as well as the rank in which the player finished in the respective Masters tournament.<br />
Because of the erratic nature of the Masters, no variable is completely reliable but the number of top 10 finishes, the previous yearâ€™s Masters rank, the season scoring average, and shots gained off the tee have noteworthy significance.  Meanwhile, shots gained on approach, around the green, and putting, have near zero correlation, because the separation of the best from the worst in these areas is less significant.</p>
