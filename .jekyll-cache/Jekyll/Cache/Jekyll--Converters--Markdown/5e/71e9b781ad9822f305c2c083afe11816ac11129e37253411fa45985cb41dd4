I"<p>In preparation for the highly anticipated UFC title fight between the current Menâ€™s Lightweight champion, Khabib Nurmagomedov, and contender, Justin Gaethje, Iâ€™ve analyzed over 8 thousand UFC fights to gain a greater understanding of the sport of MMA and to determine what factors contribute to a fighterâ€™s success.  The UFC judging system is subjective in nature, which often leaves fans confused about the outcome of fights.  By looking at fight data, we can better recognize fight strategy, the impact of fighter attributes, and the match decision made by the judges.  The UFC fight data sets can be found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rajeevw/ufcdata" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/calmdownkarm/ufcdataset" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
