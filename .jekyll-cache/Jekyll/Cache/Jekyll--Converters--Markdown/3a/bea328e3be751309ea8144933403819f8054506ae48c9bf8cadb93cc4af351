<p><strong><em>Betting Tips</em></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The Eagles have great Super Bowl value at +1400.  Our forecast gives them 1/12.5 Super Bowl odds and a 28% chance to get to the NFC championship game.</li>
  <li>For a sleeper Super Bowl pick, the Falcons at +3000 is our recommended bet. They are projected to have the easiest strength of schedule in the NFL and they have a 55% chance to win their division and play at least 1 home playoff game.  They also have the 4th best odds in the NFC to to earn the first round playoff bye.</li>
  <li>The Browns to make the playoffs at +145 is great value for a team with a 42.9% chance, despite a challenging division.</li>
  <li>The Lions to earn NFC #1 seed at +600  and the Chiefs to earn AFC #1 seed +350 both payout high for their respective odds (Lions 17% and Chiefs 24%).</li>
  <li>The Rams to win their division at +350 has slight edge given their 22.9% probability to take the NFC West.  All 31 other division winner bets on Draftkings have negative edge.</li>
