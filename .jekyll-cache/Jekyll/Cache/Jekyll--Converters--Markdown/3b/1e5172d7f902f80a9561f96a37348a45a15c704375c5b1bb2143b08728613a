I"<p>Every year after MLB’s first month, there seems to be one or two players who are on pace to break Barry Bonds’ homerun record, or a team that is on pace to have the best record of all time.  Of course, we all know that these are unlikely outcomes because of the statistics phenomenon of ‘Regression Towards the Mean’.   The law of Regression Towards the Mean asserts that as a sample size gets larger (number of games), variables (player and team statistics) will move closer towards their true average.</p>
