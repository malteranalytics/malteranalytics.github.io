I"ÿ<p>This post will demonstrate how to use the AWS Rekognition API with R to detect faces of new images as well as to attribute emotions to a given face. In order to do this, I use the <a href="https://paws-r.github.io/">paws</a> R package to interact with AWS. The output image will label a new, unseen image with the name of the individual as well as the emotions tied to the face for that image. A video of this tutorial can be
seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dd8aYsye9Qo">here</a> or below.</p>
