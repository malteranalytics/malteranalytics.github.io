I"«<p>Next month, May 8<sup>th</sup>, will mark the 75th anniversary of Victory in Europe (VE) Day, when Winston Churchill announced Nazi Germanyâ€™s unconditional surrender from World War II, officially bringing an end to the Holocaust and to the war in Europe.  Defeating Fascism required a well-planned, well-executed war strategy along with the sacrifices of millions of people who contributed to the Alliesâ€™ efforts.  To better understand their strategy, Iâ€™ve created a visual analysis from over 175 thousand records of documented Allied aerial missions by the United States, Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand, across all theaters of operation from the 6-year war.</p>
