I"P<p>Thereâ€™s no doubt that Gerrit Cole is an elite pitcher playing for a great team, the New York Yankees.  He finished second in the AL Cy Young award in 2021 with a 3.23 ERA, however, Vegas bettors seemed to think that the Yankees were a better team with Cole on the mound than they really were.  According to the Vegas opening moneyline consensus, the Yankees had an average win probability of 65.6% when Cole pitched in 2021 and sometimes a win probability as high as 80%.  Seven times throughout the season, our model at <a href="https://www.gamewagers.ai/" target="_blank">Game Wagers</a> found positive edge betting against the Yankees when Cole was on the mound.  At first glance, it seems counterintuitive to bet against a name like Cole, so we analyzed our picks and found that our Game Wagers model had positive return against Cole.</p>
