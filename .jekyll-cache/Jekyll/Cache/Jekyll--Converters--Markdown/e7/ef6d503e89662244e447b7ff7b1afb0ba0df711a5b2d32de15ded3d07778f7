I"¦<p>Major League Baseballâ€™s Statcast has done a lot to improve how playerâ€™s movements are analyzed, but little public research has been done using video and image processing to improve mechanics of players and to help prevent injuries.  In part, this is due to the fact that machine learning related to images and videos requires lots of storage and high computing.  Even though storage and computing are relatively cheap, there is a small cost and high complexity associated to performing data science on this type of data, which creates a barrier to entry working with it. Additionally, MLB and individual teams own video rights making accessibility of data difficult.</p>
